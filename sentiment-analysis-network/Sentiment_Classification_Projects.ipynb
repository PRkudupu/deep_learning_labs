      "brilliant over  acting by lesley ann warren . best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen  and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none . the corn on face is a classic  as good as anything in blazing saddles . the take on lawyers is also superb . after being accused of being a turncoat  selling out his boss  and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently  i  m a lawyer  he says . three funny words . jeffrey tambor  a favorite from the later larry sanders show  is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto . his character is more malevolent than usual . the hospital scene  and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site  are all  time classics . look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting  one bleeds  . this movie gets better each time i see it  which is quite often  .  \n",
      "this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon . sure  its flawed . it does not give a realistic view of homelessness  unlike  say  how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers  or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots  . many of the jokes fall flat . but still  this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not  and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive . its not the fisher king  but its not crap  either . my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead  i love mel as a director and writer  not so much as a lead  .  \n",
      "this is not the typical mel brooks film . it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable . leslie ann warren made the movie  she is such a fantastic  under  rated actress . there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more  and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so  but all in all  this is worth the price to rent and see it . the acting was good overall  brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience . again  warren was the best actor in the movie  but  fume  and  sailor  both played their parts well .  \n",
      "this isn  t the comedic robin williams  nor is it the quirky  insane robin williams of recent thriller fame . this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over  dramatization  mixed with robin  s new love of the thriller . but this isn  t a thriller  per se . this is more a mystery  suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper .  br    br   also starring sandra oh and rory culkin  this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report  until william  s character gets close to achieving his goal .  br    br   i must say that i was highly entertained  though this movie fails to teach  guide  inspect  or amuse . it felt more like i was watching a guy  williams   as he was actually performing the actions  from a third person perspective . in other words  it felt real  and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story .  br    br   all in all  it  s worth a watch  though it  s definitely not friday  saturday night fare .  br    br   it rates a  .     from . . .  br    br   the fiend  .  \n",
      "yes its an art . . . to successfully make a slow paced thriller .  br    br   the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don  t even notice it happening .  br    br   fine performance by robin williams . the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film . however  the core plot is very engaging . the movie doesn  t rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering . the direction is good . use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good .  br    br   very nice  time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story   \n",

      "you know  robin williams  god bless him  is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade  with perhaps the exception of  death to smoochy   which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic  . the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic  especially  insomnia  and  one hour photo  .  the night listener   despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release  is among his best work  period .  br    br   this is a very chilling story  even though it doesn  t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter . the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed . in high school  i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson  who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result . i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist . when i saw this movie  the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind .  br    br   toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic  caretaker  . her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like  little miss sunshine  . there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me . it takes a good actress to play that sort of role  and it  s this understated  yet well reviewed  role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award  as of      . it  s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this  and it  s scary too .  br    br   this is a good  dark film that i highly recommend . be prepared to be unsettled  though  because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end .  \n",
      "when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves . that being said  we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood . . .  br    br   writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded   br    br   with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life  jess  and the world around him  donna  .  br    br   as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably . the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward .  br    br   it  s to bad that most people will avoid this film . i only say that because the average american will probably think  robin williams in a serious role  that didn  t work before   please give this movie a chance  robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people . like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art .  br    br   oh and before i forget  i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in . he has the      s leading man looks and screen presence . it  s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now    br    br   s  \n",

      "there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times . constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis  have kept psychologists  counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades . occasionally  some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence . that is the premise of the film entitled  the night listner .  it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon  robin williams  who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles . perhaps its because his show is losing it  s authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself . feeling abandoned by both his lover jess  bobby cannavale  and his and best friend  joe morton   he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation . it is here  a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help . noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a   year old boy called peter  rory culkin  . in reading the boy  s harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents  noon is captivated and wants to help . however  things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en  wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare . this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d . logand  sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop  this might be comical . instead  this may prove to be one of william  s more serious performances .   \n",
      "i enjoyed the night listener very much . it  s one of the better movies of the summer .  br    br   robin williams gives one of his best performances . in fact  the entire cast was very good . all played just the right notes for their characters  not too much and not too little . sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch . toni collette is great as the mom  and never goes over the top . everyone is very believable .  br    br   it  s a short movie  just under an hour and a half . i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version . i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie .  br    br   the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion  which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well .  br    br   do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads . it is not a hitchcockian thriller . see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well . if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed .  br    br   my only complaint with the movie was the ending . the director could have left a little more to the audience  s imagination  but this is a minor quibble .  \n",
      "the night listener is probably not one of william  s best roles  but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie . i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before . some people maybe won  t like the slow pacing of this movie  but i think it  s the great plus of the movie . it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year     . it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content  dramatic feeling . this is no americanized movie . neither is it a predictable movie . you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be . this is no excellent movie that has everything  but hell  it  s a damn good and very original movie .  \n",
      "like one of the previous commenters said  this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery . such a waste because collette  s performance was eerie and williams was believable . i just kept waiting for it to get better . i don  t think it was bad editing or needed another director  it could have just been the film . it came across as a canadian movie  something like the first few seasons of x  files . not cheap  just hokey . also  it needed a little more suspense . something that makes you jump off your seat . the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax . i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the  reality  of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy . this movie needs to have a director  s cut that tries to fix these problems .  \n",
      "the night listener held my attention  with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a   year old boy  rory culkin  who is very ill . williams has never met the boy in person  as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone . however  williams  ex  boyfriend  nice job from bobby cannavale  raises doubt about the boy  which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person . what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect . i will leave it at that . toni collette also stars .  br    br   i enjoyed this film  with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin  s adoptive mother . sandra oh also starred as williams  friend . the night listener is inspired by actual events  and it has a somber  almost creepy silence throughout . at times it is predictable  no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic  but i liked it anyway . i enjoy williams in roles like this  more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me . recommended .      \n",

      "if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing . the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery  and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about . however  there is not much tension  and williams  mild mannered portrayal doesn  t do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy .  br    br   collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear . the production felt rushed and holes are apparent . it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort . the book is probably better .  br    br   one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort .  \n",

      "this night listener is better than people are generally saying . it has weaknesses  and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis  no doubt  but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this . the whole thing feels like one of those fireside  this happened to a friend of a friend of mine  ghost stories . one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate . everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility  and real life just sort of plods alongno  so there are no flashy endings or earth  shattering revelations  no  showdown  scenes . thank heaven . you have to get into the zone when watching this movie  forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a  conventionally  good movie . williams isn  t terrific  but he easily meets the needs of the story  plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic   no one   as he is the everyman  the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story . toni collette  s performance should be nominated for an oscar  even if she maybe shouldn  t win it  . give it a shot . for quality and content alone  the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days .  \n",

      "i loved this movie since i was  and i saw it on the opening day . it was so touching and beautiful . i strongly recommend seeing for all . it  s a movie to watch with your family by far .  br    br   my mpaa rating pg    for thematic elements  prolonged scenes of disastor  nudity  sexuality and some language .  \n",
      "the movie titanic makes it much more then just a  night to remember .  it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten . why so criticised  i have no idea . could  will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it . could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece . it will be almost impossible .  br    br   the director no doubt had the major impact on the film . a simple disaster film  boring to watch  converted to an unbelievable romance . yes i  m not the romance type either  but that should not bother you  because you will never see a romance like this . guaranteed  everything to the amazing effects  to the music  to the sublime acting .  br    br   the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling . everything looks very real and live . the legend herself  titanic  is shown brilliantly in all classes  too looks  too accommodation . the acting was the real effect . dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles . no one could have done better . they are partly the reason why the film is so great .  br    br   i guess it  s not too much to talk about . the plot is simple  the acting is brilliant  based on a true story  probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears  thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten . well if you haven  t seen this film your missing out on something hesterical  and a film to idolise for hollywood . could it get better  no . not at all . the most moving film of all time  don  t listen to people  see for yourself then you will understand . a landmark .  don  t be surprised if you cry too   \n",
      "i had few problems with this film  and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated . true  it is over three hours long  but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly . i don  t think it is overrated at all  i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent . the film looks sumptuous  with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects  and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus . leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack  and kate winslet is lovely as rose . david warner  a great actor  steals every scene he  s in . the story is very rich in detail  and is hot on character development  obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be  though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow . the last hour is extremely riveting  and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat  when the titanic sank . i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving . the music score by james horner was lovely  though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on . the     miniseries was good  but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies . overall  i give titanic an  .     . bethany cox .  \n",
      "i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies . anyway  everyone remembers the rms titanic . it was big  fast  and  unsinkable  . . . until april     . it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever . well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship . well  onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film .  br    br   so our two main characters are jack  leonardo dicaprio  and rose  kate winslet  . they  re not annoying too much but watch this and you  ll find out why they could become annoying  http   tinyurl . com  ojhoyn  . the main villain i guess is bad luck  fate  hand of god  no blasphemy intended   or just plain caledon hockley  billy zane  . combine all of the above and what do you get   oh yes  we get a love story on a sinking boat . the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite  mr . andrews  victor garber   idk he was so nice   lovejoy  david warner   murdoch  ewan stewart   lightoller  jonathan phillips   captain smith  bernard hill   molly brown  kathy bates   and many more . we also got the present day treasure hunter  brock lovett  bill paxton  . they add something to the story  something good . the action in here is awesome  especially in the second half  the drama as also good . in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears . the story is simple and it works . a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond . she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic . two lovers separated by social class and ultimately  the fate of the ship . everything about the story works and there are very few flaws . i give titanic  an    awesome  \n",
      "titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill  fated voyage on the unsinkable ship . writer  director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april        claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic . the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet . they make for a good on  screen couple . dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable . they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well . the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane  kathy bates  frances fisher  jonathan hyde  and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film . the love story  the action  suspense  and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time . the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation . the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it  s few flaws . titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it . the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg . overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill  fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch .  \n",
      "the ship may have sunk but the movie didn  t    director  james cameron  from  the terminator  did it again with this amazing picture . one of my favorite scenes is  the dinner table  scene  in which rose  s family and friends meet jack after he saves her . rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet  the one  . . . i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband .  br    br   jack and rose have a connection that is  movie stuff  but it  s good movie stuff . we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth . rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her . i really liked the hanging over the boat scene . it was a good risk .  br    br   the movie is long but it  s fantastic    good story  good flow  good actors    go see it twice if you want  its worth it     \n",
      "titanic has to be one of my all  time favorite movies . it has its problems  what movies don  t  but still  it  s enjoyable .  br    br   when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic  i suppose my first reaction is  wait a minute  you don  t   i know so many people who don  t like this movie  and i  m not saying i don  t see why .  the love story is too cheesy  well  yes but isn  t it enjoyable and moving  all right  the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic  everyone knows that love like this doesn  t actually exist . but this is a movie  doesn  t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while  the next complaint  dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors . well  ok  in this movie  i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials . however i think it  s unfair to say that they are terrible actors . i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in . but the roles they are given are simple  and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit  but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected .  br    br   and finally  if one is going to complain that they don  t like this movie because they hate romance  or because they hate history  or tragic movies  then i  m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things . it  s like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies . simply for being a movie  not because you dislike the genre  this is a good movie .  br    br   well deserving of its oscars  in particular  best cinematography  which i find to be the best i  ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy .  br    br   i know some of the writing fails  such as the constant screaming of each other  s names throughout the movie . the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times  but overall it  s an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real  and the sinking feel so epic .  br    br   i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie  but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea  such as it being a love story  rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed .  br    br   i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic  including memoirs form the day it happened  and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults . the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper  not steel  and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it .  br    br   i give this movie       not because i like romance movies  but simply because it  s an outstanding cinematic achievement  that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events .  \n",
      "titanic is a classic . i was really surprised that this movie didn  t have a solid ten  overall in the imdb user rankings . maybe  it  s just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays  but when it was first made it was really something . when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters . when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month . it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason . some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot  like the frozen baby  or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd . many people died on that ship  and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to . and let  s not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose . whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone  s imagination it was lovely . they barely knew each other  but they would die for each other . they trusted each other . they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money .  i  ll never let go  jack .  titanic is a great film down to it  s very core . it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting  excellent cinematography  beautiful music  and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers . it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie .  \n",
      "another aussie masterpiece  this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural  and it does very well . it doesn  t resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks  it focuses more on emotional impact . a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney  co . bring to life . it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside  and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago . strange things begin to happen in the house  and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared  who was actually a mass murderer . highly recommended .      \n",
      "for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time . no exceptions . james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller . through films such as aliens  the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science  fiction goes . he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film . but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance . the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises  plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows . the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful  interesting and entertaining film about it . the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren  t given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose  gloria stuart  tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose  s and jack  s story alone  no one else . emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home . the music has become iconic and legendary . it is composer james horner  s finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience . the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is . only one problem  the usual james cameron problem  is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside . james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime . my heart won  t go on from this one .  \n",
      "back in      do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research  the unfortunate death of princess diana  the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets . this was also the big year in the release of titanic  one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams  about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster . i don  t think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was  the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans     of them being teenage girls  i was   years old at the time  and of course saw the movie multiple times . it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful . at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong  of course i grew up and didn  t watch the film since i was    a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for  .   and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now . was it worth the hype  was it really the best movie of all time  was that leonardo  s real nose  ok  i know that  s silly to say  but i did re  watch the film . being completely honest here  titanic is a great movie  best movie of all time  no  just depends on your idea of a good movie  but titanic delivered in romance  humor  disaster  emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage .  br    br   the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic  searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean . unsuccessful  they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude  wearing the heart of the ocean  dated the day the titanic sank .

skeptical team on his salvage ship . when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace  rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic  revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater . in      the upper  class    year  old rose boards the ship with her fianc  cal hockley and her mother  ruth dewitt bukater  both of whom stress the importance of rose  s engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt  bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper  class  rose and her mother are financially broke . distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage  rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern . before she leaps  a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes . jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life  and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first  class formal dinner of the rapport  building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance  music and beer in third  class . but after cal  s servant informs him of rose  s whereabouts   rose is forbidden from seeing jack again . however  after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven  year  old daughter to behave like a  proper lady  at

in the ship  s first class staircase . jack and rose return to the top deck  the lifeboats have gone  and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down .  br    br   so does titanic live up to it  s hype  i still say that this is a great movie to watch  i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie . but it has great acting  amazing effects  a well  written story and still looks flawless . love it or hate it  you have to admit this movie didn  t get a lot of hype just because of leo  s baby face or kate  s amazing ability to cry on sight  this film is something special . it will always hold a special place in my heart  it has too seeing that i saw this film  times in the theater when it was released . but all that aside  i do recommend this movie  it  s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day .  br

      "titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic . the plot is simple  noncomplicated  or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense . the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film  but the love story is an interesting one  however . kate winslett is wonderful as rose  an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal  billy zane  . early on the voyage rose meets jack  leonardo dicaprio   a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game . if he wants something  he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries . the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes .  br    br   the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures  that sunk with the titanic  which has recently occurred . one of the survivors of the titanic  rose dewitt bukater  who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search . she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic . with this  the scene shifts to southhampton  ireland where the titanic set sail from on april        as all the passengers are boarding . after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york . historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful  but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger  jack dawson . captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned . smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty  two years of experience to stretch the titanic  s legs out to full speed . the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs  but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie . on april        at       an iceberg was sighted . they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film . the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate . the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until     when the lights finally failed . the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic  s many pleas for help . the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own . the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship . overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too . the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking . also  the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold  which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle . overall  the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic .  br    br   many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship . the core group of rose  jack  cal  and rose  s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time . yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer  thomas andrew the white star line representative  bruce ismay and all of the titanic  s officers were real . the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith  s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards . he had been a part of the white star line since     where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire  s captain when the titanic sunk . the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol . he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer  s former canadian hometown . as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower  class passengers from non  english speaking nations . in addition  officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted . the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss  . not wanting to leave her husband  s side mrs . strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic . furthermore  mr . goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best . the richest man on the ship  john jacob astor  who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well  but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat . in addition  molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water . her ticket on the titanic had cost over four  thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke . all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware . the gymnasium  which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs . the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re  creation of the post  victorian era of     . the rich at this time practically ruled everything  as the women  s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet . women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do . the rich did not take well to new money  such as molly brown as depicted . everything of the time was very formal . women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes . smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes  which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie . men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes . women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society . although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross  referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken . the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking .  br    br   a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise . the director  james cameron  shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people  s lives . everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night . in addition  this film is a reflection of the      s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic . only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored . this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed . however  the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed . there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed . as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter .  br    br   technically the film is very well done . to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie . in addition  a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean . cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the   years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship . furthermore  throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage . this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner . at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film .  br    br   titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art  a true epic . like most history novels  we know the ending  but it doesn  t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture . certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming  sound  cintematography  and editing . if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early      s and how they face disaster  then this movie definitely is for you .  br    br    \n",

      "after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted  urban  turn of the century australian street  we meet julie  rebecca gibney  and peter  john adam  as they go out house hunting . they manage to get a loan for a fixer  upper on a posh sydney street  but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home . it just may be haunted .  br    br     gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker .  br    br   the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget  but not wholly excusable to that hurdle . a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film . the opening  thriller scene  features some wonky editing . freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there  s not much action . suspense should be created from staging  not fancy  fix it in the mix  techniques . there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location  the lighting  the fog and such  but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim  cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street  showing their increasing proximity . the tracking and the cuts need to be slow . the attack needed to be longer  clearer and better blocked . as it stands  the scene has a strong  made for television  feel  and a low budget one at that .  br    br   after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves . the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror        though the budget forces a much subtler approach . millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios  often dramatic in nature instead of special effects  oriented  such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron  which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall .  br    br   for some horror fans  the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama . at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in . but morphett writes fine  intelligent dialogue . the material is done well enough that it  s often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later   especially if you  ve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house .  br    br   once they get settled and things begin to get weirder  even though the special effects often leave much to be desired  the ideas are good . the performances help create tension . there isn  t an abundance of death and destruction in the film   there  s more of an abundance of home repair nightmares . but neither menace is really the point .  br    br   the point is human relationships . there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting . the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it . that it  s in a posh neighborhood  and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies  shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe  such as money or health problems . peter  s character evolves from a striving corporate employee with  normal  work  based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive  scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful . at the same time  we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be . julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown  but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship .  br    br   although   gantry row never quite transcends its made  for  television clunkiness  as a tv movie  this is a pretty good one  with admirable ambitions . anyone fond of haunted house films  psycho films or horror  thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy . it certainly isn  t worth spending    for a dvd  that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it  factoring in shipping and handling    but it  s worth a rental  and it  s definitely worth watching for free .  \n",

      "king of masks  bian lian in china  is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film . winner of   awards from around the world  this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian  a street performer in     s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face  change opera . he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance  and no one knows how he does it . he has a longing desire to have a grandson  as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir . we then go to the streets  and see that people are selling their children because they can  t afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free  because daughters are not worth much in this society . wang bianlian  s story goes on from there .  br    br   the film was so astonishingly good  the acting was amazing  and the issues were so weighty and well  addressed . there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place  no one wants a little girl . also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman  and while he is famous and well  respected  he regards himself as something low  a half woman . as we go further into the film  the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it  the brutality and corruption of the military and police  and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions .  br    br   this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life  and xu zhu  the actor who plays wang bianlian  presents yet another beautiful performance .  \n",

      "this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone  but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation . women and performers  both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star  are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china . this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture .  br    br   the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors  performance .  br    br   a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies .  \n",

      "this is probably my favorite movie of all time . it is perfection in its storytelling . it will break your heart not because it  s over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through . you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time .  \n",

      "elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film  but it is great entertainment in the quasi  melodramatic mode . it is the story of love  both genuine and illicit  as well as overweening ambition  devotion  and the arrogance of personal tyranny . a previous reviewer  john mankin  questions why the central focus of the film  the mansion called elephant walk  should have been built by the former owner  the  governor  the late tom wiley  right across the elephants  traditional path to the major source of water  the river . to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man . that his son  played by peter finch  should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father  is not unexpected  since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father  s rowdy  boys  club  as his role models . the point of the father was that he was a self  made man who would tame nature to his liking  and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated  but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd  and thus he would dominate his son and all around him  and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water . who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water  this is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love  ceylon  today  s sri lanka  is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story  not just the expenses of miss taylor . were it not for this exotic location  much of the film was shot in ceylon   and the magnificent  bungalow  this would have been just another potboiler . one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place  as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant  conquerors  that were part and parcel of the british raj . it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony  teak  and marble . not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees  grille work window and doorway borders  evidently specified by art directors j . mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island . such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought .  br    br   for those immune to the blandishments of time  place  and architecture  there is always the allure of miss taylor  as she marries a man she doesn  t really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man  against the background described  and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased . as i said  it is not great literature nor even great film  but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today .  br    br   this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive  in  not on the home tv  so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera  work and scope .  \n",

      "i loved this film . not being a swooning ed wood jr . fan  i prefer to appreciate his  boundless enthusiasm  and acknowledge his shortcomings . his movies are fun  but his personal story is one racked with pain . i hoped  and was delighted to find  that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life  rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise . from beginning to end  this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology  leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr .  br    br   what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives  positive and negative  and showing us their character as much as ed  s . we get insight into ed  s personal and professional life from his romances  to his drinking  to his sexuality  to his friends  to his enemies  and even to his film making .  br    br   the film itself is shot in a low  budget way that seems done out of respect for ed  as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from     would be disrespectful  sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president  . the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background .  br    br   fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies  and new comers will be amazed that this man was real . the dvd is full of impossible to find gems   crossroads of lorado  and photo galleries   but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story .  br    br   ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him  for better or worse   to the point where one woman will go down in history as  swimming pool owner  for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool . this ability to define a person  s legacy comes through universally  as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr .  but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created . somehow  without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time  the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear  and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement .  br    br   even the title hints at the b  list horror genre  but by the end  we see that even this is a kindness . what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood  s legend .  br    br   in many ways a living contradiction  ed wood jr . could not be condensed to a single viewpoint . this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get . being itself a juxtaposition of themes  it is at once respectful  provocative  thoughtful  gripping  fun  sad  kind  and fulfilling .  \n",
      "  the haunted world of edward d . wood  jr .  is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as  glen or glenda    bride of the monster   and  of course   plan  from outer space  . this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries  such as  look back in angora  and  the plan  companion   failed . it rounds up his surviving entourage  many of whom have passed away since filming  and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work . nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood  sentimental in its treatment of the director  down to the haunting music   this documentary is an absolute must  see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day . the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed  s life and untimely death for the viewer . best watched at  am while wearing an angora sweater .  \n",

      "anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike  s work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director . in keeping with miike  s working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script  this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller  with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with . what takes the movie out of the realms of the same  old same  old however  is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today  s cinema . and this isn  t that nice cool  clean violence so beloved of us cinema  this stuff is nasty  painful and hurts  that said  the pace is breakneck  the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities  miike  s sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments  and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be  making it hard to look away from the screen  whatever he might be showing you  it doesn  t have the  ohmigod  ending of  dead or alive   but if you  re not squeamish  now  s the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studio  s  new john woo  shopping list . . .  \n",

      "the movie starts something like a less hyper  kinetic  more pastiche dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers . but when a police officer is killed  one tatsuhito gets involved . . . and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved  things get bloody quite fast .  br    br   an earlier work of miike  s  shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol  ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts  though it  s not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces . rather  it  s a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction  as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground  a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almost  brothel of young boys  one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning  . tatsuhito  s brother is getting involved with said society  so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm .  br    br   what  s mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis  wang . tatsuhito is a japanese born in china  later moved back into japan  and alienated for it . wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china  so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan . wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character  which is weird enough as it is  much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be . and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he  s forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother . while it would be rude to state that miike  s movies are successful mostly on their shock value  it is true that sometimes it  s easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter  dis  impassioned characters .  br    br     polarisdib  \n",
      "while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike  s later films this is a very good crime drama .  br    br   the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster . complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang . the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust . its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film .  it is a very very good one  this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don  t mind a no frantic pace .  br    br   a word of warning  the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty . there are also semi  graphic depictions of gay sex . if thats not your cup of tea  proceed with caution .  br    br    or  out of   .  \n",
      "i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why . one of the problems is the cultural  language one . here we have a chinese  taiwanese  japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties . another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences . nevertheless  it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that . plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence  a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect . all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one .  \n",
      "shinjuku triad society chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals . why  could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk  and the victims enjoy it  or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull  these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story . it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon .  br    br   should you see this film  yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema . the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters . if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar  barring the insane ending in doa of course  . great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano . the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd . if i haven  t put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i  m sure it will come out in that country .  \n",
      "shinjuku triad society  albeit from perfect  is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber  conventional realm . it  s a yakuza  triad picture  involving cops versus japanese   or chinese gangsters  mostly chinese  as the title suggests   but already even in his first technical  debut   takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here  on in . social issues like black market trading of precious goods  in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and one  s roots  which was especially prevalent in dead or alive   thumbing  of  the  nose at taboos like gay sex and  satirical  rape  violence towards women blood  curdling violence . it  s certainly not as surreal as some of miike  s most recent films  but this is expected as he  s trying out things that he  s just starting to learn  following a track record of straight to video programmers . it  s got all of those qualities  and it  s also  like the films that would follow from it  equally savage and heartfelt  crazy  in spots  and sardonic in its drama  and solid for genre fans .  br    br   the story concerns two brothers  one a chinese orphan raised in japan  tatsuhito kiriya  kippei shiina  pretty decent as a eastwood  esquire anti  hero  hero   who  s become a detective  and another  who  s become a gangster  or a would  be one . the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang  a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare  time  played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes   and his partner karino  takeshi caesar  who  s threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who  s just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal   who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie . there  s some intrigue involving the organ  trading scheme with the gangsters  which kiriya almost becomes a victim of  and the gang  s penchant for gay sex  at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want . it all leads up to vengeance and redemption  qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare  hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying  it won  t come off   .  br    br   if it doesn  t add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have  it  s par for the course of a film like this . miike  s goals are met  though just met  in his low  scale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble  the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents   notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime  and what the realm of unrepentant sex  with both sexes  brings out psychologically in the characters . at the same time  shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black  comedy from the miike oeuvre . some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness  like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face  or the randomness of the  interrogation  as it goes into a very twisted area . there  s even a laugh  out  loud line from the young sex  slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses  thank you  mr . weeny  burger .  miike and his writer don  t have enough here to make the film a full  on dark comedy like ichi or  of course  visitor q  but there  s enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters .  br    br   as the first entry of the  black society  trilogy  as it  s called  i was quite impressed  and it  s a fine quasi  calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema .  \n",
      "this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy  and the trilogy kicks of to a great start . the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically  and these themes are actually apparent in all his films  if you look close enough . shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders  struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza . the kid brother is a lawyer  and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one  as the movie progresses . the movie takes place in a very harsh environment  and is therefore pretty violent and tough . miike has done worse  but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard . as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex  mostly homosexual in this one . the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie  but with a great drive and true grittiness . if you  ve only seen miikes far  out movies  ichi the killer  fudoh etc .  this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over  the  top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side  as seen in the other films of the trilogy . and as always with miike  there are at least two scenes in this that you  ll never forget  see it and figure out which ones for yourself  .  br    br        \n",
      "a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true  miike  film and i thought this sort of description might have been a clich . but  like all clichs  it is based on the truth . all the miike trademarks are here  the violence  the black humour  the homosexuality  the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character . shinjuku is however  one of miike  s most perfectly formed films . he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different  but not necessarily better . i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film .  br    br   as you might expect  the violence is utterly visceral  gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face .  only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that .  the film has a fantastic pace  unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle . dead or alive also deals with similar issues  miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here  the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past .  br    br   i cannot sing shinjuku  s praises enough . i do not want to give away too much . this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano  s sonatine . the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you  ll be popping it back on again to work it all out .  \n",

      "i  m not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a  master  in the genre of horror  since he previously just directed one horror film called  wrong turn  and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre  but fact is that he made with  right to die  one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the  masters of horror  franchise . there was a similar underdog story in season one  when william malone made on of the best episodes with  the fair haired child  even though his other long feature films  fear dot com  and  house on haunted hill  sucked pretty badly .  br    br   the story of  right to die  cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia  but thankfully also features multiple old  fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance  murderous conspiracies  pitch black humor and comic book styled violence . whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband  s continuous adultery  the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident . cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially . whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney  corbin bernsen of  the dentist   want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor  abbey  s mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff . meanwhile abbey  s hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff  s surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices . after a few victims  cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well .  right to die  is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv  series concept like  masters of horror  . it  s violent and gory with a sick  twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences . the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well  yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons . the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling . actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks  which is always a welcome plus  and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean  spirited and egocentric bastard . great  moh  episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons .  \n",
      "well its about time . i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season  s entries . while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries  at least this episode turned out well . its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season . in  right to die  we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey . at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation . abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back . while they speak  they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises  but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire . and this is just the setup people . once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes . there  s also a side effect too . every time she flatlines  abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people . hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever . from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it  right to die should have the right to go on living forever .  \n",

      "this is the first michael vartan movie i  ve seen  i haven  t seen alias  and i was curious to see if the guy can act . he sure can and is likable in this movie . natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles  so i found her very good and lovable in this different  sweet  role of a schoolteacher . some of the negative comments i read are true  the movie is full of clichs and the story doesn  t ring true at all . also  even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together  i don  t think there is screen chemistry there . however  i enjoyed this movie . the locales are nice  the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good . if you are expecting to see a great romance  this is not it . but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good .  \n",
      "i just can  t understand the negative comments about this film . yes it is a typical boy  meets  girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by . henstridge  talk about winning the gene  pool lottery   is as magnetic and alluring as ever  who says the golden age of cinema is dead   and vartan holds his own .  br    br   there is simmering chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene  lots  it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together . . .  br    br   ignore the negative comments  if you are feeling a bit blue  watch this flick  you will feel so much better . if you are already happy  then you will be euphoric .  br    br    ps i am    male  from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess . . .   \n",
      "this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than   why not  it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ . johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most  like our churches . the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it . great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans . at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians . thanks fox for producing it . as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece . movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves  in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright  honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith   \n",
      "this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash  adorned in black  of course  who sings a lot and narrates a bit also . if you like johnny cash  this film is quite enjoyable . also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work . . . just for fun  try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair . . .  anyway  its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all .  \n",
      "johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories . the music is great  you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like  i  ve been there too   and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion . cash  s narration is good too .  br    br   but . . . .  br    br    . the actor who played jesus was miscast .  . there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music .  . because it is uncompelling  i doubt we  ll see this ever widely distributed again .  br    br   i  d love to buy the cd .  br    br   tom paine texas  usa  \n",

      "i wait for each new episode  each re  run with anticipation  the new look of sci  fi created by stargate sg   is a wonder that i hope will never end . to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me . season   should be a thrill in itself . i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season  as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o  neill . the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner  season after season . you cancel this program in the next three years  and you make a serious mistake . also  you need a bigger role for the asgard  they are just too cool .  \n",
      "i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b  rated movie . i came out surprised and very amused . eva was good  but lake bell stole the show . she had amazing comedic timing . the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between . the plot was enough to tie it all together  a woman  eva  dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was  to  be husband  its sounds far  fetched but it actually works quite well .  br    br        overall its a worthwhile cinema watch  if not get it on dvd when it comes out .  \n",

      "look it  s eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend . it  s gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore  sex panther cologne  in anchorman . if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies . however  if you are willing to suspend reality for   minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you  ve come to the right place . the characters are all funny . they work together very well . the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell . he  s as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time . i went with my wife  she enjoyed it and so did i .  \n",

      "once when i was in college and we had an international fair  the russian section had a soviet  era poster saying  ne boltay    meaning  don  t gossip   . i  translated  it for the  generation  of tv watchers as  don  t be gladys kravitz    in reference to the nosy neighbor on  bewitched   .  br    br   however  when you see the result of gossip in the pvt . snafu short  rumors   you see that it  s not quite a laughing matter . in this case  the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states . so  he tells it to someone  who tells someone else  who tells someone else  and it continues . as in  the russians are coming  the russians are coming   the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time  so that when it gets back to snafu . . . well  you know what i mean  yes  it  s mostly wwii propaganda  complete with a derogatory term for the japanese  but i have to say that the pvt . snafu shorts were actually quite funny . of course  since they had dr . seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices  it  s no surprise that these came out rather cool . worth seeing .  \n",

      "rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring  private snafu .  the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed  animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros .  termite terrace  including friz freleng  chuck jones  and carl stalling . the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu  and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel  i . e . dr . seuss . the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery  using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope  the little twerp who would do everything you  re not supposed to do . according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials  but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes  certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow   all for the greater good  of course .  br    br   as the title would indicate  this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors . the setting is an army camp . private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine  something you won  t see in any other hollywood films of the era  and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling . we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted  then exaggerated  then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp . the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot  while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air  i . e  balloon juice .  a soldier  shoots his mouth off   cannon  style  and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction . winged baloney  at that . panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized  coney island wiped out  enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn  and the japanese are in california . the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for  rumor  itis  and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell .  br    br   this is a highly effective piece of work . the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy  and the message is still a valid one . in recent years we  ve seen that catastrophic events  real or imagined  can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances . because the technology has improved  the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e  mail  cellphones and blogging . consequently  rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn  t feel at all dated in fact it may be more timely than ever .  \n",

      "tim krabbe is the praised author of  het gouden ei   a novel that was put on the screen twice   spoorloos  and  the vanishing   . one of the dutch writer  s more recent works is  de grot   a psychological thriller about two totally different men  egon and axel  who meet at a youth camp and  surprising enough  become friends for dear life . egon is a quiet  somewhat dull person  who spends his time studying and writing geography books . axel  on the other hand  is a charismatic  party  animal   a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday  s concern is to get a woman into his bedroom . from the moment they meet  axel has a strong influence on egon  while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything  such as reading thick books like egon   ultimately  egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself  which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country .  br    br   after having read the book last year  i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it . in my opinion  the book suffers especially from the complex structure . while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people  the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically  so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode . because of this  the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a character  s background to really care for him or her . another complaint was the fact that the main characters  egon and axel  are a little stereotypical . egon is  the  dull intellectual  while axel is his exact opposite . in real life  such one  dimensional people rarely exist in books and films  they always seem to be there  taking away a lot of credibility .  br    br   despite all this  the film was a pleasant surprise  being much better than the book . the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography  humour and acting fedja van huet  egon  is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting  which is  in my opinion  the highest an actor can achieve  . the drawbacks of the film  however  are the same as the book  s mainly because the characters are one  dimensional  they are so predictable that it becomes annoying . guess who wrote the script  indeed  krabbe himself . it is obvious that this talented director  that  s what the movie makes clear anyway  is hampered by a deficient screenplay . perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book .  br    br        \n",
      "  de grot  is a terrific dutch thriller  based on the book written by tim krabb . another of his books   het gouden ei  was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called  spoorloos    the vanishing   in     . this one is not as good as that thriller  although much better than the american remake also called  the vanishing   but there are times it comes close .  br    br   especially the opening moments are terrific . we see a man  later we learn his name is egon wagter  fedja van hut   coming from a plane in thailand . when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border . these scenes are perfectly directed  photographed and acted . a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this . later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman  both stating that they have never done anything like this .  br    br   from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash  forward . we see how egon  still as a child  here played by erik van der horst   befriends a guy named axel  as a kid played by benja bruijning  . we learn how they grew up as friends  sort of  and how axel  as an adult played by marcel hensema  became a criminal . egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman . around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him .  br    br   the movie is chronological in a way . it shows egon and axel as kids  than as students  young adults  and in their mid  thirties . but from time to time  like i said  the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again . every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults .  br    br   minor spoilers herein .  br    br   the title means  the cave   and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending  although it is in fact not that happy . like the beginning  the ending is terrific . the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes  only to come back at that point in the end . it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending  although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well .  \n",

      "de grot is a very good film . the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb  who also adapted this story for the screen . some really top  class acting  not only by van hut  but especially by marcel hensema  who mostly did tv  work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf . the film seems to kick of as a thriller  and sets an excellent mood . then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf  and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash  back structure  which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character  driven drama of the movie . in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending  that will grab audiences by their throats . make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie . a must  see  especially if you liked  spoorloos   the vanishing  s original screen adaptation  .  \n",
      "i started watching the show from the first season  and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it . original movie was kind of childish  and i was just looking for some sci  fi show while waiting for the bsg new season .  br    br   but after few episodes i became a fan . i  ve loved the characters  the not  so  stupid  as  you  think  he  is jack o  neill  the not  only  smart samantha carter  the glorious teal  c  women and kids favorite  and brilliant dr . daniel jackson .  br    br   of course  stories sometimes not serious  sometimes even ridiculous  but mostly it  s not about technology or space fighting  it  s about helping your friend  even risking your life for him . it  s about  we don  t leave anybody behind  . struggling to the end when all hope is lost . about the free will  and all good qualities that makes a human  human .  br    br   and now it  s breaking a record  going   th season  and still doing good .  \n",
      "indian directors have it tough  they have to compete with movies like  laggan  where   henpecked  castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots .  devdas   a hapless  fedar  festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion  with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one  s feelings or sentiments  alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry . but to make a good movie  you have to tight  rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum  dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit  bollywood  leading actor who is marginally handsome . so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words  defending his village  this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience . there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar  narasimhan  . nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him  meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson . this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india . nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films . the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with songdances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won  t sell  a sad but true state of affairs . faster this changes better for  bollywood  . all said and done this is one good movie .  \n",
      "i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought  hey  another film starring aishu and shah rukh  little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just   minutes . shakti is a film about a mother  s love and endurance . it  s a film about transformations  ignorance  coming of age  stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life . the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie . it  s actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk  s drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze . he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day  dressed scantily and begins to seduce him . the title of the song is  ishq kamina   loosely translated as  love  s a bitch    and it is just plain smoking hot  don  t miss it .  \n",
      "good movie  good music  good background and an acceptable plot . but the main point again as his movies tend to be  the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold . nana patekar . this may be his second best performance after parinda  others may disagree  . although other movies are not far behind . one man that will never ever disappoint you .  br    br   good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without . you can see in his movies  others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins . but this man is really something elase .  br    br   the movie is cool  the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good . a must watch .  \n",
      "this is probably karisma at her best  apart from zubeidaa . nana patekar also gives out his best  without even trying . the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag  especially when shahrukh comes in the picture . what really made me like it were the performances of the leads  the dialog delivery  as well as the story  for what it was . it could  ve been directed better  and edited . the supporting case was even great  including karima  s mother in law  even though she just had one shining moment  it was great to watch her .  br    br   the sets were also pretty good . i didn  t really like their portrayal of a canadian family  but once they step in india  it  s as real as it gets .  br    br   overall  i would give it a thumbs up   \n",
      "a strong woman oriented subject after long  director krishna vamsi  s shakti  the power  the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevi  s first home  production . a story about a woman  s fight against harsh injustice .  br    br   the story of the film revolves around nandini  karisma kapoor  who lives in canada with her two uncles  tiku talsania  jaspal bhatti  . there she meets shekhar  sanjay kapoor   falls in love with him and they soon marry . their family is complete when nandini has a boy  raja  master jai gidwani  . but their happiness is short lived  as the news of shekhar  s ailing mother  deepti naval  makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india . and that  s when the problems start . from the moment they reach  br    br   india  both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere . they take a crowded train to reach shekhar  s village and when they finally reach the station  they have to catch a long bus drive to his village . the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never  ending drive . and unfortunately for them  a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus . fortunately  they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him . after that  they drive to the handing havel where shekhar   s father  narsimha  nana patekar  lives with his wife  deepti naval  . nandani realized that her father  in  law is in command as soon as she enters the place  but her only solace is her mother  in  law  s warm welcome .  br    br   living there  nandini learns of her father  in  laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him . the day she sees her father  in  law teach her son to throw a bomb  she loses it and lashes out against him  insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada . but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day  leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father  in  law . her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart  wrenching film .  br    br   what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie . the only drawback is ismail darbar   s music  which fails to rise above the script . the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena  which has been composed by anu malik . another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast . karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother . she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal . second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film . his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he  s shown his versatility once again with this role . sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors . deepti naval too is in top form and her pr  climax showdown with nana is praiseworthy . shahrukh  s cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he  s been pulled in to get the required star value . though his role was not really required  he  s done it well . overall  shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr  release hype is sure to get it a good opening . shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up . so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least  reels to better the impact . shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch   \n",
      "seeing this movie was the most fun i  ve had at the cinema in a long time . however  i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film  because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied . this picture has everything any movie could ever have . it has characteristics of a romantic comedy  a political commentary  a thriller  a drama  an action movie  a musical  and an absurdist self  conscious art film . it  s all in there  adding up to a myth .  br    br   the basic premise is about an indian couple  nandini  karishma kapoor  and shekhar  sanjay kapoor   happily living in canada  who rush to india to visit the husband  s parents after a disturbing news report . the rest of the story takes place in india  where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence . at one point  the story borrows from  not without my baby   but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice .  br    br   the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions  including shah rukh khan  s dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie . in fact  the two stars are on all the posters  but they appear really late in the film  and only shah rukh ends up being a real character . yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance .  br    br   karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film  and she does an admirable job  having to link up the film  s twists and turns with a show of believable emotion . another notable presence is nana patekar  who plays narsimha  the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar . nana patekar dominates every scene he  s in with a scary but nuanced character .  br    br   the movie is not without its share of realism . violence is rampant  but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters  with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions . at times  this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic .  br    br   i have seen a share of bollywood releases  and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm . but  shakti  raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous . it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy  where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained . it is pure  gratuitous cinema  and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book . perhaps  the all  important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind  but i came out of watching  shakti  exhilarated . making movies can be the most fun in the world   \n",
      "okay  i know this does  nt project india in a good light . but the overall theme of the movie is not india  it  s shakti . the power of a warlord  and the power of a mother . the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth . then things go terribly wrong . the interaction between nandini and her father in law  the power of their dysfunctional relationship  and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie . shah rukh khan  s performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor . it is easy to get caught up in the love  violence and redemption of lives in this film  and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax . the musical interludes are strengths  believable and well done .  \n",
      "well  i  ll be honest it is not exactly a sholay . but you cant get a sholay every week . in fact  you could see distinct signatures of  not without my daughter   sally field       in this movie . however  as most  inspired  movies go  this one was a well  inspired one  well handled and well done . nana patekar  as usual  tends to overdo his hysterics  but all others are commendable . specially so about dipti naval saw her after a long time  but she hasn  t lost any of her grace . in fact  she has performed much better that when i last saw her . another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age   br    br   all in all  a nice watch .  \n",
      "the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother  s love  the exceptional performances  the steady execution and the quite innovative script . the film tells the story of an indian woman  nandini  who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja . all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india  of whom she had not even known  is in troubles and the couple rush to india . when they get into the village  nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture shekhar  s family  ruled by his cruel  highly cynical and merciless father narasimha  lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless . nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home  but he is soon killed by his father  s enemies . when she wants to leave  narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india . here starts the intense struggle which can be called  nandini vs . narasimha  .  br    br   india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film  but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas  so it may be even correct . the portrayal is in my view fair and not one  sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent . such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world . the locations are amazing  the music is wonderful  and krishna vamshi  s direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing . one thing that must be noted is the very ear  pleasing background score by ismail darbar  it is beautiful . the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film . portrayed realistically throughout  the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch . its dialogues are superb and intelligently written  and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points  a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension .  br    br   the film  s biggest strength is the performances . karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini . her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible . she displays so much intensity  impulsiveness  anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son . her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child . after fiza  this is her most powerful performance . one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen  nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha . he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him . patekar displays cruelty  wittiness and even humanity with total conviction . he is outstanding . another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india  s most underrated actress  deepti naval  who sensitises her character to perfection . sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief . anyway  do watch shakti  it could have been better  but it is definitely a must  watch .  \n",
      "if any movie stands out extremely with the actors  acting skills  this is probably the one . i  ve never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way  but having a strong feeling . the movie was disturbing at moments . however  the movie was terrible at editing . the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs  yet they feel out of place . like karisma is getting beat up  and the same time srk is fighting  comically  with the police officers . the ishq kamina song was very out of place . on top of that  the movie is overly glossy in the beginning . the direction was not bad  but certainly nothing one can brag about .  br    br   i have to say that the actors  were chosen very wisely . without them  this movie would not have an impact . karisma kapoor has given her best role to date  and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza . she looks pretty in the first half  and i  ve never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her . what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date . nana patekar was excellent as her father  in  law . not much to say about him  besides this is a role made for him . deepti naval as the mother  in  law was excellent especially in her final scene . though she doesn  t have much to say  her facial expressions and body language was good . the other good performance was the little kid . he was adorable  and is sure to bring tears to the viewer  s eyes . the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances . sanjay kapoor was all right  but he didn  t have much to do . shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role .  br    br   one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina . the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song . and boy aish is mad hot . however  the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever . people may have come to the movie for aish  but they won  t brag too much about it after  wards . hum tum miley was properly paced  but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie . damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about . dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie . despite the poor editing  the performances alone make it a must see .  \n",

      "uneven bollywood drama . karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend  sanjay kapoor   has a child  and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords . drama and tragedy ensue  and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller . film is compelling  its few song  dance numbers are uninteresting and needless  the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film  s drama  at least once we  ve left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative  if ultimately misplaced as well . likewise  the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy  go  lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce  and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with . his throw  away comic  book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film  s primary gripping drama . the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord  and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long  suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film  s best scenes ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay  s sisters in india  and very pleasing eye candy . but sanjay himself overacts terribly  especially during obvious ad  libs . the directorial style of writer  director krishna wamsi is sloppy  rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts  although his camera movement is good . the musical underscore is also quite effective  moody  featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble  too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti  s soundtrack cd  but bollywood hasn  t yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums  at least not in most cases  . but shakti is karisma kapoor  s film  all the way  though  and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes . despite the unevenness of much of the picture  karisma  s performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures . in a strange way  also  i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i  d noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette  both of which i  d seen just prior  although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorism  controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china  s tang dynasty  whose self  serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext .  \n",

      "on sunday july         the first episode of a new science fiction series called  stargate sg    was broadcast on showtime . a spin  off of and sequel to the     film  stargate  starring kurt russell and james spader  the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film . for ten seasons  it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg   . originally  the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o  neill  two  l  s    michael shanks as dr . daniel jackson  amanda tapping as captain samantha carter  christopher judge as teal  c and don s . davis as major general george s . hammond . for ten long years  we watched the team battle against the goa  uld  the replicators  the ori and many other aggressors . at the same time  they forged alliances with the asgard  the tok  ra  the rebel jaffa  the nox and the tollan . they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up  not until death claimed them . and sometimes not even then .  br    br   as with all long  running series  they were numerous cast changes . michael shanks left the series in january     at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor . daniel jackson  s successor as the team  s resident archaeologist  geek was jonas quinn  an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara  played by corin nemec . however  shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june     and nemec left at the same time . unfortunately  he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards . don s . davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march     as he felt that it was time for him to go . the show  s original star and arguably its most popular actor  richard dean anderson  starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons . his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons . he finally left  sg    in march     in order to spend more time with his then six  year  old daughter . jack o  neill was by far my favourite character in the series and  truth be told  i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason .  br    br   the ninth season represented a new era for the programme . with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa  uld and the replicators in season eight  many fans felt the series should go out on a high . regardless  the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa  uld as the series  main adversaries . three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re  invention . ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt . colonel cameron mitchell  the new leader of sg   . his  farscape  co  star  the lovely claudia black  began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious  sexy  hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran  a former goa  uld host and con artist from another planet . a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons  she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season . rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry  the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o  neill and general hammond . for the last two years  they starred alongside the  sg    faithful  michael shanks  amanda tapping and christopher judge  and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise .  br    br   alas  all good things must come to an end . during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten  ratings dropped considerably  resulting in cancellation in its august     . after ten seasons and    episodes  the dream was finally over . on march         what began with  children of the gods  ended with  unending  . the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci  fi channel in the united states on june        .  br    br   in the ten years that the series was on the air  it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series   star trek   in terms of popularity in certain countries . it became the second  longest running sci  fi series in the world  second only to  doctor who              and the longest  running american produced sci  fi series  having surpassed  the x  files  only a few months before it ended .  br    br    stargate sg    represents the cornerstone of the  stargate  franchise . in      its success and popularity led to the production of a spin  off series entitled  stargate atlantis   which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and    episodes in august     . although plans for another feature film fell through  two direct  to  dvd films   stargate the ark of truth  and  stargate continuum   were released in     and more are planned for the not too distant future . a third live  action series   stargate universe   is also due to premiere at some point next year .  there was  unfortunately  an animated series   stargate infinity   which ran only from     to     but the less said about that the better  . despite the end of  sg    and  atlantis  as continuing series  the future of  stargate  looks very bright indeed .  br    br   in conclusion  while  stargate  has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci  fi television franchises such as  star trek  and  doctor who   its still relatively new compared to those two sci  fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many  many years to come .  \n",

      "i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating  s some people have given it . it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated  now if you don  t like comic books or animation then of course you won  t like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me . though  if you are a fan of interesting  strong characters and heroic  sexy  women kicking butt and saving the world  hell  you will love this movie . i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie . quite anime  esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation . like titan a . e . meet  s the live action version of punisher . in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie .  \n",

      "most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character  it is not really audrey tautou  s real life personality  hence  every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part   part   etc .  br    br   now with that said  i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it . yes  it  s true  there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn  t seen at all for maybe   min  but i didn  t even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters . the guy who lies about everything is too funny  the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss  actually . . . . getting into all the characters here could take quite a while  but this is one of the best movies i  ve seen in a while .  br    br   audrey tautou  s character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was . in fact  as irene  her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first . in this film  irene is a girl with good intentions  but over the course of a  very awful  day  her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic .  br    br   what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building . . . very entertaining to watch  great scenery and shots  very colorful and never too slow  and all of the characters can actually act . the best part of the movie comes with about   minutes left . . . . this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense  and the whole butterfly effect blossoms . i swear  it was the best   minutes of film i  ve seen in quite a while  and the ending . . . . it made me think  damn i really lucked out finding this movie  . the ending to this movie is top notch . whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant  because not only are there all these other subplots going on  but to somehow make them all tie in together  and in a sensible manner  which is the case here  but also to make each character feel human and come alive  not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect . . . very impressive .  br    br   i highly suggest this movie as it  s a great film to watch anytime  in any mood  with any company or alone .  \n",
      "the mystery here is why this delightful  small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves . simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti .  br    br   lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations  its rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and  unlike some of its more critically acclaimed competition in the genre  such as the taste of others  it actually entertains .  \n",
      "the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific . according to this theory  somehow related to the chaos theory  i  m not sure exactly how   every action  no matter how small or insignificant  will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events . this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly  unrelated characters  most of them in paris  whose actions will affect each others  lives .  the six  degrees  of  separation theory can be applied as well .  each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film . the acting is finely  tuned and nuanced  audrey tautou is luminous   the stories mesh plausibly  the humor is just right  and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement .  \n",
      "we have to remember that the    s were practically a blank slate when it came to movies . hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies  noir  two reel oaters  etc to movies with a message . we had blackboard jungle  on the waterfront and so on . some folks might think that was an improvement . i don  t . who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message  call western union  he was right . these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy .  br    br   this one is a pip . it  s about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father  s estate . one of them  maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay . he  s initially in it for the bucks  but eventually falls for her . meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance . the results are predictable . you get a little bit of everything in this movie . sexual tension between the sisters . a little subtle masochism . hereditary insanity  if there is such a thing . we never get to meet the parents  but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown . one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar . the acting is so bad it  s hard to believe . it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel  air productions . it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits . the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke . it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene .  br    br   i can  t explain it  not even to myself  but i gave this pile of trash an     . i  m familiar with the term  it  s so bad it  s good   but i don  t think i ever ran into the phenomenon before . well  maybe  hot rods to hell   but this one certainly fits . you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody  s basement .  \n",

      "here  s another movie that should be loaded into a satellite  fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity . this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip  off of the already bad movie classic king kong from     that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness  but successfully predicted much of peter jackson  s miserable     computer cartoon bearing the same name  as far as a  romance  between the giant  here a yeti  and a gorgeous human female  antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi  s city of the living dead  who is very easy on the eyes  .  br    br   the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex   the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package  the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness . but as a trade  off you do get a wacky old scientist  two inquisitive kids  tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain  a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure  dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while  and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti  who turns out to be the good guy  glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands  a monster who  s size literally changes scale from shot to shot  some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison  crowd reaction shots a  plenty made up of either spanish  italian or canadian extras depending upon scene  you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed   and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie .  br    br   it  s here that the film won me over it  s enthusiasm just for being made . frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in     and god  s gun the year before this  was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action  adventure genre film scene from the      s       s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work . i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever  or rather the one he took the most chances with  and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids  families . the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless . or rather they are part of the fun  and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn  t have worked   which is exactly why peter jackson  s movie sucked .  br    br   he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators  and with all it  s faults  clunkiness  kramer  s yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this  which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages  not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space . i  d rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it  curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever . because the movie looks so  fake  you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked  trampled  tossed about and smashed . knowing that and armed with a fertile  energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie  parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend . this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid .  br    br         it  s about ten minutes too long but who cares  you only come around once and i  d rather go out with a smile on my face .  \n",

      "hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones . the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers . as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes . where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure . sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood .  \n",
      "this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong  s  new wave  that began with tsui hark  s  zu warriors of magic mountain  . tsui set a tone for the new wave  s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave  jackie chan  sammo hung  wong jing  ching siu tung  etc .  accepted from then on as a given namely  the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony  if not outright comedy .  burning paradise  put a stop to all that  and with a vengeance .  br    br   it  s not that there isn  t humor here but it is a purely human humor  as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw . but this is just as humans are  not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time .  br    br   when irony is at last introduced into the film  it is the nastiest possible  emanating from the  abbot  of red lotus temple  who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before . he is the very incarnation of milton  s satan from  paradise lost    better to rule in hell than serve in heaven   and if he can  t get to satan  s hell soon enough  he  ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule .  br    br   that  s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here it  s not that the abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair  to feel utterly hopeless  to accept his nihilism as all  encompassing reality . thus there  s a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself  it has become all there is to the universe  and the abbot  claiming mastery of infinite power  is in charge .  br    br   of course  fortunately  the film doesn  t end there . though there are losses  the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails .  if you want to know how  see the film   yet there is no doubt that  in viewing this film  we visit hell . hopefully  we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience  and somehow better for it over all .  \n",

      "i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart  but i was flabbergasted when i saw the  .  rating to one of my childhood favourites . it doesn  t wow me as much at    but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie . kids will definitely love it and won  t mind the flaws  and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film . none of the film was preachy in any way  in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness . i will admit though that the story is on the thin side  and some scenes like screweyes  s death  which still freaks me out  may be a tad on the scary side . but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation . the music by james horner is very beautiful  and the song featured is memorable  catchy and amusing . i really liked the characters  louie is probably the most in  depth of them all  but the dinosaurs were at least engaging . martin short  s clown was both hilarious and emphatic  the part when he tells screweyes  i quit   had me in stitches . my favourite is screweyes though  an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent . if anything though  i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could  ve been more developed in terms of depth . the script  while not oscar  worthy  has its funny and heart  warming parts  and should keep kids and adults entertained . the voice acting for me was what made the movie . john goodman  martin short  rhea perlman  felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances  but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable . all in all  this is a good movie . i don  t get the rating  honestly i don  t . sure this film isn  t perfect  and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time  but it is good fun .  .     bethany cox  \n",
      "i saw this when it first came to video  my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably   at the time . . . what stood out for me was the lack of mid  movie conflict that so many movies have  where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don  t say the one thing that you  re shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal  that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say . this is what i like the most about the movie i guess  that the main characters don  t do mean things to each other halfway through . . . they don  t break up and make up  they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on .  br    br   these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track  they  re not that different . loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family  and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone . anyway  i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again . . . sure there  s plot holes if you analyze the script and no  woog and dweeb shouldn  t be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality .  br    br   now  what detracts from the film is it  s unexpected scariness . little kids under the age of  would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr . screweyes . and  the addition of him halfway through the movie  though it  s blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance  is too abrupt . . . there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie  perhaps to show that it  s not that scary without the the dinosaurs . i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie  so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half .  br    br   considering the target audience  who i  m sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues . . . i think i  ll give it a pass on those factors too  and just enjoy the story . it  s a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind . . . makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every   years i think .  \n",

      "this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best . at the same time  it looks realistic and unrealistic  just knowing that the movie is fake . the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways . a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address  and it includes a manga video  showing the torture . the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die . some scenes are shocking  such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched    times  because you see punches in nearly every movie . this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people   or older .  br    br        \n",
      "the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape  complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame . it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black  clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers  her hand smashed with a hammer  her eye punctured with a needle  and so forth .  br    br   in the most nauseating scene  the woman  s captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns . the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen  believing the series to contain actual murder  attempted to ban its distribution in the united states . an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers   sick re  creations using nasty  but obvious special effects . gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic  book artist hideshi hino  who also directed the third and fourth episodes  this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms . but  gorehounds probably won  t find anything special .  \n",

      "wow  alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here . wonderful . my name is steve and i run unearthed films . we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america . now before you ask why am i writing a review  instead ask why some people bash it . i  m writing this review because i love the guinea pig films . why do i love em  it  s because they go for the throat and they don  t let go . i  ve seen it all . almost every horror film known to man  argento  fulci  bava  buttgereit . from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster . i  ve seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films . why because it doesn  t try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the  st place . this review is for the devils experiment . i find it devoid of story which is fine by me . why do i watch horror films  so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people . the devils experiment not only delivers but that  s all it is . pure unadulterated violence . yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold . why do people bash it . cause they like a story  so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story . it make em feel better about themselves . we all want blood and gore . it  s just really hard to justify it if it  s not wrapped around a story . the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released .  br    br   i  m thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world . maybe i shouldn  t have written this review but then again maybe i should . my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it  s not . i  ve always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films . sure it  s exploitive and over the top but isn  t that why we watch horror films in the  st place . the devils experiment is not for everybody . it  s for thrill seekers and gorehounds only . if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those . but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you . there is a reason why they haven  t been released for over   years . they are wrong  disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom  unless she is totally cool . good luck  enjoy and never stop living your life .  \n",
      "a lot of people unfairly sh  t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining . devil  s experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work   not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic   especially for the video  s vintage and low  budget .  br    br   let me start at the beginning now for those who don  t know this film is an  extreme  torture  fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid    s . it  s plot as it stands is simple a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is . this entails brutal violence   all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl  s arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound .  br    br   the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground . these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings .  br    br   the actress who plays the victim of the  experiment  is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera . her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling . some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest . also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes .  br    br   if you haven  t seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot .  .     for devil  s experiment .  \n",
      "my rating refers to the first  seasons of stargate sg   which are wonderfully fresh  creative and addicting . when the cast stepped through the gate  you never knew what lay on the other side  starting around season   the show took a different focus  still good  but different .  br    br   the series follows the adventures of a team of humans  and one alien  who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the  stargate  . the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie  stargate  in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt .  br    br   the episodes are light  innocent and easy to watch  and very creative . many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci  fi movies of their own . what happens next was always unpredictable .  br    br   the characters on which the show rests are also well  defined and brilliantly performed . their tone is serious  but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor . they are simply fun to watch .  br    br   starting somewhere around season   the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe  the goa  uld  then the ori  . the plots become more complex  a lot more political  strategic oriented  and interdependent . the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature .  br    br   one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the    th and    th episodes . they are simply can  t  miss shows . they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through   seasons .  br    br   if you are a sci  fi fan  watch a few episodes of the first  seasons and you  ll likely be hooked . if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides  you have   seasons of shows to look forward to .  \n",

      "first off  this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to . the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema  apparently its the other way around . if one were to look back after the film it really wasn  t meant to be convincing  it was a low budget ipecac . but really thats all it was aiming for  it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value  and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions  .  br    br   i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific  in non  shock sense  it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid  pessimistic  i didn  t trust anyone for about a week because i didn  t want to wake up strung up and tortured   \n",

      "  house of games  is a flawlessly constructed film  and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends . i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert  s review  which proclaimed it the best film of     . i had my doubts  mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year . boy  was i in for a surprise . this was one of the smartest  most well  written movies i had ever seen .  br    br   the screenplay is quite a piece of work  not only in terms of the plot  which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out   but also in terms of character development . on my second viewing  i began to realize that mamet  s screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film  but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations . the climax of the movie is particularly effective  because it is absolutely inevitable . it stems naturally from what we know about the characters  and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending . the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film . i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike  and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset . their work  plus mamet  s extraordinary screenplay  combine to create one of the greatest films of the      s . it is truly a must  see .  \n",
      "just watched the film for the  rd time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before . it just keeps getting better and better . you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech  the slow deliberate action  everything being exactly in place .  br    br   truly one of the great ones and definitely my all  time favourite     \n",

      "i enjoyed this show for two reasons  . richard dean anderson  . amanda tapping . these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors . the replacement of rda in seasons     was enough to take the heart out of the show .  br    br   the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous . you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling . this relationship carries over into the program we get to see .  br    br   rda gives his  o  neill  character believable personality . he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest . you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances . still  they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous .  br    br   there is a lot going on between  carter  and  o  neill  under the surface . they manage to keep the lid on  but often just barely . the episode  solitudes  in season  had some of the best drama ever seen on television . the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together .  br    br    carter  and  jackson  often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by  o  neill  . yet  o  neill  s  tactical instincts always seem sound . he understands what to do without having to think about the matter . the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders .  br    br   the quality declined markedly in seasons  and   . the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest . ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show . he had his rare moments with claudia black  but that was all . amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons . you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby . she was probably thinking more about the child than the show .  br    br   the spin  off  stargate atlantis  has a few moments  but is mostly a weaker effort . the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original . the villains  wraiths  are so improbable as to be ludicrous . maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won  t last beyond the fourth season .  br    br   there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show . to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci  fi . the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad . the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra  modern technology is just as hard to accept .  br    br   i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too . in the season  opener   daniel jackson  is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded . he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet . the episode  hathor  has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc  yet it is never mentioned again . this device could have been used in several later episodes on  daniel    o  neill   and  dr . frasier  .  \n",

      "i  m a big fan of films where people get conned  and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the  films where people get conned  genre . in short  it  s an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels  and never truly revealing what  s happening  while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you  ve just seen . the film cons the audience on many occasions  and despite us knowing this it  s still difficult to guess where it  s going  and every twist comes off as a surprise . as mentioned  i  m a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler . she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient  and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con .  br    br   house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout  and david mamet does well in establishing his film  s setting in the underground levels of the city . the film is well acted also  with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill . joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film  and although his performance is a little under wrought  he  s always solid and believable as the villain of the piece . lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work  and again is believable in her role . she may not be the greatest looker  but at least she can act . the way that the film executes it  s plot is the main star of the show  however  and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer . at times it  s almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film . another thing that  s great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons  which is useful if you  re interested in making twenty bucks  say . all in all  house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride .  \n",

      "opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama . all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener  and the performer  intrigued and entertained applies to this film . there isn  t a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad . mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor . if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended  as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited .  \n",
      "this is very nearly a perfect film . the ideas would be repeated by mamet  but never told so succinctly . this is really about the failure of trust  of the human condition . the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals  no one is innocent . is there anyone alive today who hasn  t seen this play out in our own society  every single day  the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller . except  there are no more innocent characters . the world is now completely polluted  ruined and everyone is participating in the con . could anything be more true   br    br   don  t miss the soundtrack . it is wonderful .  \n",

      "i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn  t the goal . his character is like all of us . wanting more  better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver .  br    br   morgan freeman made a great god . with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself .  br    br   i thought jennifer aniston  s character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry  s basically self  centered tv anchorman wanna  be but that  s the way it was written .  br    br   i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened .  br    br   i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep . this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart .  br    br   a funny film .  \n",
      "i am a very big jim carrey fan . i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura . i also like him in his serious movies  especially truman show . this one is a cross between his very funny side  and his serious side . he is of course very funny in this movie  but there are parts that are very serious  and he pulls it off with a lot of ease . he is truely a multi  function actor .  br    br   as for the rest of the cast  i was happy with jennifer aniston  s acting . i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass . morgan freeman makes a very cool god . as for steven carell  his limited scenes are very funny  especially in the anchor scene .  br    br   overall  i would have to rate this a  . good acting  funny script  and some very serious situations make this a very good film .  \n",
      "i would have rated the series a perfect   for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season     br    br   the final episode of the   th season  unending   where  it would certainly appear that  the asgard have been killed  off in a very rushed  unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion  left me in disbelief   br    br   from the extremely rushed end of the series  it  s obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season . my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg   franchise for the two upcoming direct  to  dvd moves   br    br   unless the asgard return in a future sg   movie  with a very good explanation of the  apparent  extinction   i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean  up of loose  ends   br    br   poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci  fi series .  \n",
      "i first heard about this film about   years ago when i was a kid in grade school     it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day  and under the entry for movies  or cinema  i don  t remember   were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental  and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon . it really intrigued me  since it stood out the most on the page  it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it  .  br    br   about   or so years later  the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole   dvd set of  treasures of american film archives  released by the national film preservation foundation . so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set  i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs . after all these years  i could finally see the film  after viewing it  it slightly wasn  t was i was expecting it to be  it tended to be a more organic  looking film  not that that  s a bad thing  but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic   but it was still an impressive film  imho  considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film  including hand  tinting the film itself  and using video equipment for some of the film  s scenes  filmed off of a video monitor   giving it a more distressed  lo  res look .  br    br   don  t get me wrong  the techniques used in this film were quite ground  breaking for     . that  s why it  s still one of my favorite short  experimental films  and a creative inspiration for me as well . . .  \n",
      "a very funny movie . it was good to see jim carrey back in top form . it was definitely worth the price of admission . morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film . i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however  still a good film to see .  \n",
      "bruce almighty  one of carrey  s best pictures since . . . well . . . a long time . it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too . . . morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny . it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes . the best scene in  it is where jim is messing up the anchor man  s voice .  br    br   my rating      \n",
      "this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made . carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film . he was both funny and sad . carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan . nolan blames god  morgan freeman  for everything that goes wrong in his life . then  god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers . as i said before  carrey did an excellent job . i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actor  actress . the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point . this movie can be funny  bruce  s dog  as well as sad  the  break  up   . the script worked well  too . i am glad they made a sequel to this film . i rate this film a     .  \n",
      "bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan  an average man who feels god is messing up his life . god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways . of course  giving someone god  s powers could take a turn for the worse . bruce almighty is a good comedy  jim carrey is good  as always morgan freeman is first  rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well . the jokes are almost always on target  although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey  s facial expressions . i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god  not only that but also as a black man . i thought this quite well  especially with the brilliant freeman . there are some hilarious scenes  the opening cookie scene for instance  others miss the target slightly but still a good film .    out of    \n",
      "  bruce almighty  looks and sounds incredibly stupid  especially from the trailers . nevertheless  i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more . bruce  jim carrey  is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job . morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god  and though it isn  t his usual type of film or one of his best roles  he does excellent with what he is given to work with . although crude at times  the film does have quite a few laughs  from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers  reactions to him  as well as freeman  s seemingly laid  back and wisecracking image of god . it is overly exaggerated at times  and there is some crude humor  but overall it manages to be somewhat funny . there is a decent supporting cast  such as jennifer aniston  lisa ann walter  and steve carrell  which always helps . the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear  jerking  and the message is clear  that we should do what god has called us to do and  be the miracle .  the film is far from perfect  but still enjoyable  and far better than i and many people probably would have expected  especially if we see the deeper message of the film .  br    br    out of   \n",
      "if you want a serious laugh pain  watch this movie  and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster . the deleted scenes are priceless . i don  t know why they didn  t include them in the original movie . it can  t be because of time  since the movie is only    minutes long . morgan freeman is a brilliant actor  who has been overlooked for too long . jim carrey needs meds   \n",
      "as someone who lives near buffalo  new york  this movie scored points with me before i even saw it  since the story is based here . there are even some bit parts with real  life news  tv anchor people from buffalo . . and  for once  it doesn  t knock the area . hallelujah   br    br   theology  wise  puh  leeze    god is still made to look and think like humans . . . and  of course  be a bit on the liberal side . being the lightweight comedy it is  it  s nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill    minutes .  br    br   there are some laugh  out  loud slapstick comedy scenes and  hopefully  audiences  from christians to atheists .  got something out of this besides a few laughs  such as what prayer should really be all about . kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message .  br    br   overall  it  s a good  hearted film that should offend very few .  \n",
      "i really do not know what people have against this film  but it  s definitely one of my favourites . it  s not preachy  it  s not anchored by it  s moral  it shouldn  t be controversial . it  s just god . any possible god  no matter the religion . and it  s really funny .  br    br   jim carry plays bruce nolan  a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news  desperate to prove himself  more or less to himself  that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job . this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace  jennifer aniston  away . when the final straws are executed  he  s quick to not laugh  but yell in the face of god  who in turn gives bruce his powers . bruce then makes his life better for himself  until he  s guilted into helping others  where he then continues to miss the point of his powers . meanwhile  his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish  leaving his relationship on dangerous ground .  br    br   ok  that was kinda long . but as a plot  it works well . the step  by  step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together  and is able to hide itself fairly well .  br    br   as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place  carrey  s pitch  perfect acting stays in character  which  luckily enough  is him   and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene . whether they would admit it or not  the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey . without him  the humour would turn flat  as humour is half execution . and the humour is very good in the first place . but without carrey  it would kinda feel like a it  s a wonderful life wannabe .  br    br   jennifer aniston is great and  no matter what some may say  does not act like the only excuse for the third act . at least  you don  t think that when you see her . she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you  re watching a movie  she and carrey feel very much like a real couple .  br    br   the movie feels ggooooodd  see the movie to understand   has a very nice feeling  tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey  s career  which wasn  t goin  anywhere .  .  \n",
      "well  was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns  this film sure was better than that bore   oh  god  . i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through . carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe  and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance . i  for one  don  t consider her to be either ugly or untalented . i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history . see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one . well written and even better played out  this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman  s best .  \n",
      "now either you like mr carrey  s humour or you don  t . me  myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and  on the other hand  cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth . bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream  but you have been warned .  br    br   if you  re not sure  watch the trailer . i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film . if you don  t find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny  don  t bother with the movie .  br    br   carrey  a reporter stuck in a rut covering  lighter news  berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot . god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better . carrey gets into the swing of having all of god  s powers by making his girlfriend  jennifer aniston   s breasts bigger  getting himself promoted  and answering everyone  s prayers by single stroke computer commands .  br    br   this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable  but it is very well made within it  s very limited intent  provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans  and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow  minded god  squadders and anti  god  squadders .  br    br   on the more thoughtful level  the film tempts us to speculate about carrey  s own career  stuck in his  comedy  typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes . his most accomplished  straight  role  the man on the moon  is less well known that his comedy romps  or the truman show  on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey  .  \n",
      "i nominate this and babylon  as the best television sci  fi series made . both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series  there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters . if you look at the original star trek and star trektng  they were fine shows  but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes . in many ways  you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring . this was less the case with deep space   with its giant battles that took up all of the final season  and the other trek shows  as there was more of a larger story that unified them . this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon  and saw this to an even greater extent with sg   . the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form . sure  there were a few  throwaway  episodes that were not connected to the rest  but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny .  br    br   and speaking of funny  i loved that sg   kept the mood light from time to time and wasn  t so dreadfully serious . in this way  i actually enjoyed it more than babylon  . jack o  neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson   it  s really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons .  br    br   to truly appreciate sg    you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work . this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power . and  if you don  t like sg   after giving it a fair chance  then sci  fi is probably not the genre for you .  \n",
      "starring jim carrey  morgan freeman  jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie . i mean  what a conceptual nightmare . jim carrey playing god  nothing is sacred anymore .  br    br   well  this movie is hardly sacred  but it also is not sacrilegious  at least not to any great extent . yes  jim carrey has the powers of god for a while  but he is not god . confused  i  ll give you the low down .  br    br   jim carrey plays bruce nolan  a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life . he lives with his beautiful girlfriend  grace  anniston   and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other  but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground .  br    br   then bruce gets a shot at anchorman  only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter . obviously not please  bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired .  br    br   much complaining and griping about god later  bruce gets a page . after a while he gets tired of it calling  so he responds and goes to the omni presents building  heh  . there he meets god  freeman   who is the boss  electrician  and janitor of the building . i found this highly amusing . god is the boss  the holy spirit is the electrician  and jesus christ is the janitor . think about it . boss  obvious . electrician  the guy who keeps everything running . janitor  the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left . brilliant .  br    br   anyway  bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god  but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god  he starts to believe a bit . wonder why . enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies .  br    br   since this is hollywood  bruce obviously eventually smartens up  learns his lesson  and starts using his powers for the good of the world . in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done  not bruce  s .  br    br   since it is jim carrey  the movie is quite amusing  and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it . the movie is not perfect theology  but for hollywood  it is definitely a good attempt . many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging  and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie .  br    br   so  while far from perfect  definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it .  br    br   bottom line  .  out of   worth a view or two   \n",
      "jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask  a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck . even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums  and of course they have to be mexican  obviously   his good will towards his fellow man backfires . in that case  it wasn  t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums  but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn  t be ignored . i  m reminded of the episode of michael moore  s brilliant the awful truth  when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay . the results were not very promising  so it  s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example .  br    br   jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan  the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart . or even better  it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere  a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film  . bruce is nearly   years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that  s seeking to bake the world  s biggest cookie . he  s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station  but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague . you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report . needless to say  he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film .  br    br   morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself  displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman  s massive talent as an actor . he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously  but in such a way as to advise his followers  as well as the viewers of this movie  that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life . i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day . there are a lot of people in the world  maybe more than our share in america  who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans .  br    br   one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives  and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer  s religion . i  for example  tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live . but despite the fact that i don  t believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time  i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie .  br    br   jim carrey  s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he  s come . if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura  both of which i loved  by the way  or a lot of what he did before he got into film  it  s amazing how far he  s come . he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show  man on the moon  and the majestic  easily one of his greatest films ever  . jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today .  br    br   jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie  as she did in the side  splitting office space  as bruce  s girlfriend  who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce  s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him . there is definitely some low  brow comedy in the film that doesn  t really fit with the importance of the film  s meaning or the quality of the delivery  such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene  but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura  s friend spike make a cameo appearance . as stephen king very well knows  it  s always nice to see familiar characters . it  s almost like seeing family again .  br    br   bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better  and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him . the thing i love about this is that  like i said before  religion is absent from my life  but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers . the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way  which empowers the message even more .  br    br   the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film  such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position  the jimmy hoffa scene  who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records   the scene where bruce  s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera  and my favorites  the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery  s cooking . the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes  such as when he says to god  who reveals that he  s the janitor  the proprietor  the electrician  etc  that his christmas parties must be real bashes  and to be careful about drinking  because on of him might need a ride home  i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes . a little too true  and as gallagher would add  behind every great man is also an amazed mother  in  law .  br    br   bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while  and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection . it is a comedy written and performed in good taste  but with enough relatively low  brow humor to keep the kids entertained . this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family  which is becoming rarer and rarer these days . in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie  which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy   it  s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching . don  t miss this one .  \n",
      "as long as you go into this movie knowing that it  s terrible bad acting  bad  effects   bad story  bad . . . everything  then you  ll love it . this is one of my favorite  goof on  movies watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs   \n",

      "this one and  her pilgrim soul  are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone . as i mentioned in my comment on the new series  there  s something lacking in this new series . maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned . it  s a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling  s version . however  this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too . i think the appeal is that no matter what they do  the lovers can never unite . i remember i wasn  t surprised by the korean movie  il mare   later remade into  the lake house  . i think it  s because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film .  \n",
      "this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories  i note both of them are based on short stories  .  examination day  is set in the future  year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves  huge tv  looking  phones  that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age . . . and the examination day  a point where    year  olds must undergo a government  required iq test . the kid is this story  dickie jordan  david mendenhall  is just celebrating his own   th birthday and is a smart kid  so is calm  even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades . his parents  christopher allport and elizabeth norment   on the other hand  say he shouldn  t have used his birthday wish on getting a good score  and while their reason includes that they believe he  s capable and he should have no need to worry  it  s pretty obvious they are worried . i won  t give anything away in the ending  but i will say this  there  s a point where we get a glimpse of what  s to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening  or another   his parents ask dickie whether he  d prefer to watch tv all night . by today  s standards  we  d be pleased he  d say he  d rather read and not just because there  s nothing worth watching . . . but why would his family ask this  the flavor of what  s encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon  which i hear hasn  t received a great adaptation to the screen  . i only wish they could  ve provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was . i found it to be better than the short story it was based on . i haven  t read the one that  a message from charity  was based on  but would like to since it was interesting  a    year  ld boy  peter  robert duncan mcneill  is suffering a fever from unclean water  that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown . . . but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever  charity payne   kerry noonann  who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him . they both recover  especially since it  s common for that to happen in      but the connection doesn  t go away . charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of     and they each enjoy each other  s company  especially peter  who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students  even at the college he  s been staying in one place at . things take an unexpected turn  though  when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the   colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment  added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever  not so common in      . the two try to learn a way to save her . the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching . both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times  through a lesson  warning that sounds like something rod sterling would  ve cooked up and entertainment  make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship  love  and wisdom do a great deal . probably    of this has no theme  but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling  s crew .  \n",

      "you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies  even the really bad ones  why  to see their heroes in action one more time . that  s the way i feel about doc savage . i am a major fanatic for the character  and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming . and the first   minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation . then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie  resulting in a somewhat disjointed film . there  s a lot of promise in here  diluted by a number of unfortunate choices  the music  the  camp  elements  etc .  but the spirit of doc is there  and that  s what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to . so  in my long  winded way  what i  m trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it  s just not as good as it should have been . and anyone who is a fan of superman  james bond  indiana jones  buckaroo banzai  and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all .  \n",
      "it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression . it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace . a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball .  br    br   likewise  an occasional excursion of  or  hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema . the presence of a radio in just about everyone  s house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world  s events and provided many a drama and  especially  comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality .  br    br   the literature of the time also flourished at all levels . the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it  what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures . but the comic book just did not magically appear  all fully developed with all the colorful  color pages  all by itself . there were mediums that were ancestral to them . obviously  the newspaper comic strip was one parent  providing the visual  narrative method of story telling .  br    br   the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine . the inexpensive  prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going  though not necessarily serialized  tales . the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough  s tarzan and johnston mcculley  s zorro . the      s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow  the avenger  g   s battle aces and the spider  master of men all found their way to the news stands  among many others .  br    br   one other was doc savage  a full  blooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps  the only  picture  of the hero . possessing extraordinary strength  super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect  doc was the prototype super hero .  br    br   he also assembled  of his former army buddies into a small  free lancing team of adventurers . each of them was an expert in a given field . so we had a top rated chemist  lawyer  construction engineer  electrical engineer  geologist  archaeologist  paleontologist  etc .  br    br   the doc savage stories were very popular in the      s and     s  and were published into the middle     s . then they went into a hiatus for a good      years . then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new  container   the paperback book . a fresh look to the cover art was introduced  featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc  with a perpetually ripped shirt .  br    br   the re  introduction proved to be highly successful  with the publication of a title a month  and for a while more  . soon  there was a rumor of a doc savage movie  but when  by what producer  well  the venerable  man of bronze  was back on the news stands for over   years before any real project got put together . it was veteran stop  action animator and producer of top special effects films  geoprge pal  who did the film along with warner brothers .  br    br   when doc savage  man of bronze arrived in the movie houses  it boasted of a well casted team of actors  albeit a largely  no name  as far familiarity with the viewers . with former tarzan of tv  ron ely  s nearly perfect casting in the lead  up and coming beauty of a starlette  pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler  as the villainous  captain seas   no other name would have been recognized . and  just maybe that was a plus in this case .  br    br   the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going . use of narration  by paul frees  and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story .  br    br   from the very start  there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured  camp  humor as the batman tv series . some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected  unlikely outcomes .  for example  an experiment of doc  s with a miniature rocket  missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish  a small one at that .  the whole story unfolds like that  hitting the viewer with a little  camp  every so often  as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously . we are also puzzled about mr . george pal  s being the producer  his last  . he who had been so well known for special effects  surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci  fi action setting of the pulp character  s world .  br    br   i can remember seeing it quite vividly . mrs . ryan  deanna  was in the hospital  just having given birth to our  nd child  michelle           . our older girl  jennifer  was visiting her grandmother  so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward  it was straight over to the old marquette theatre    rd  kedzie  here in chicago .  br    br   having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc  i was sort of let down by the final product . i could accept a little of this  camp  business  but would not have objected if mr . pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp  comic  serial type excitement .  br    br   and yet  the cast  headed  up by mr . ely and the others  made the whole film likable  if not lovable . the sets and locations were  as far as we can see  very much like those of a     s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone .  br    br   and maybe that  s just what they were trying for with this doc savage  man of bronze .  \n",

      "this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed . while late     and into     would reveal just how evil and horrific they were  this film  unlike other hollywood films to date  is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities .  br    br   the film begins in a courtroom in the future   after the war is over  the film was made in       the war ended in may       . in this fictitious world court  a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes . wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm  s life since     in a series of flashbacks . at first  it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis . however  after a while  it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster . these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama .  br    br   all in all  the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second  tier actors . there are many compelling scenes and performances   especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can  t help but bring you close to tears . it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super  creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first . overall  it  s a must  see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film .  br    br   fyi   this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film  but hitler was referred to as  that paper hanger  . this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper . this is in fact not true   previously he  d been a  starving artist   homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi . a horrible person  yes  but never a paper hanger   \n",
      "never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example norway . the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates . alexander knox   wilhelm gimm   gorky park  returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town . he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either . as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind . marsha hunt   marja pacierkowski    chloe  s prayer   played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm . there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people  s families and their entire lives . the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers . if you have not seen this film  and like this subject matter  give it some of your time this film is very down to earth for a     film and a story you will not forget too quickly .  \n",
      "the only reason i give this movie an  out of   is because there are few movies  in my opinion  that are perfect . this little b picture is a taut story  well told . i  ve always been intrigued by alexander knox  but have seen him very few movies . here he plays wilhelm grimm  a sad little man who turns into a monster . he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse . the performance is one of the most chilling performances i  ve ever seen . since world war   actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars . i imagine that since this was made during the war  the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil . but knox puts in that kind of performance   a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer . i still can  t get over it .  br    br   marsha hunt  who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly  is cast against type in probably the best performance i  ve ever seen her give  too . maybe not oscar worthy  but the best of her career . nothing against her i have enjoyed her in those  slight  roles she often played . but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama .  br    br   if you like human drama stories  or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis  i highly recommend this fine little film .  \n",
      "this one is tough to watch   as an earlier reviewer says . that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii   particularly the  liberation  of dachau . it is clear that  as of the middle of the war  we knew exactly what was happening to the jews . the sequence that shows a  transport  is vivid  almost as if based upon an actual newsreel  the nazis liked to record their atrocities  . knox as the nazi is brilliant . he charts the course of a nazi career . that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans  at first laughing at hitler  then incredulous  and finally helpless . that contrast  however  permits us to believe in the  conversion  of one young nazi officer to an anti  nazi stance . that did happen  as witness the several attempts against hitler  most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out . a strong film  effectively using flashbacks  accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended .  \n",

      "i saw a trailer for this on afro promo  the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african  americans . it looked like what it is a highly tendentious  wacky  comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay . it would seem that redd foxx  s  rf  wife has left him for his brother  who works with him at  the store  back in phoenix . he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles .  br    br   so as rf arrives  norman  wearing nothing but powder  blue bikini shorts  gets out of his waterbed to answer the door . trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the   th floor  norman tries to wake his lover  who steadfastly refuses to budge . it was just to the point where i wrote  why won  t he wake up   when suddenly he does  and me and my friend  s jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue  eyed  swirl  hairdoed garson  norman  s white live  in lover  who just  had the most faaaaaabulous dream  garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from     l . a . he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry  and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch .  br    br   norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father  s visit . garson goes to stay with waylon flowers  and madam answers the phone when norman calls .  br    br   so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico . while he is on the phone  garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him . with a burst of   s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation  but sounding more like we  re about to hear a very special track by the emotions   he realizes that his son is gay .  br    br   his first impulse is  i  ll kill him . i  ll kill him .  then rf goes on a long walk  wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have  such as  maybe we toilet trained him too soon .  his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk  for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man . surprisingly  he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality . this  it must be said  is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought . he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all   br    br   rf then hires audrey  a six  foot amazon prostitute  in this amazing fur thing  played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones . he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality  but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody .  br    br   then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night . he commiserates over the loss of rf  s wife  and tells the tale of his own mother  who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because  she was molested at a luau .  they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam  which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose . once more  mouths were agape .  br    br   so it seems that  wouldn  t ya just know it  rf and garson have a wonderful evening together  you see  staid  traditional older black men just have to see the crappy  highly  effeminate entertainment of mega  queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer  it  s really just that simple  this still does not prevent rf from yelling  rape   when garson wakes him from a bad dream . it ends less predictably than you  d think .  br    br   there was so much that was just off . what is the basis of norman and garson  s relationship  they don  t seem to have any rapport  and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out  and even when he comes around to stand up for himself  he never defends garson or talks about their relationship . there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality  and sitting right down on the park bench to read them  i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality  rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends .  br    br   other than that  it  s kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era  an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance  we could all learn to love and understand one another  and because of the whole naivet of this thing  the extreme stereotypes and message  laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated  and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past   years . i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays  female friends are desperately in love with them  and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with  and by extension convert  them .  br    br

      "this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based .  br    br   the right to be presumed  innocent until proven guilty  is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society but according to fred schepisi  s partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial  it was not granted to lindy chamberlain  accused of killing her baby . the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely  a dingo was alleged to have taken it   but those implying her guilt even more so  and there was no solid evidence against her . but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt  and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media  and the media themselves  of course  were anything but innocent in this process  . so although cleared by an initial inquest  they were later prosecuted and convicted . although chamberlain was eventually released  this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence  proving  their innocence  something no defendants should have to produce .  br    br    a cry in the dark  is well acted throughout  especially by meryl streep  who puts on a convincing australian accent  at least to this pom  s ears  and manages keep lindy sympathetic  to us  while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure . the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking  because we believe in the characters as real .  br    br   regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story  something i can  t comment on   the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership  s least charitable instincts . no legal system will ever be perfect but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away . i  m not a religious man  but the bible still contains some killer lines  if you  ll excuse the pun  .  judge not lest ye be judged  is one of them .  \n",
      "a cry in the dark  br    br   a cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid  if unremarkable film . this assumption came from the fact that aside from streep  s best actress nomination  the movie received little attention from major awards groups .  br    br   little did i anticipate that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama  well  constructed on every level . if you ask me  this is an under  appreciatted classic .  br    br   the film opens rather slowly  letting the audience settle into the chamberlain  s at a relaxed pace and really notice that  at the core  they are an incredibly loving  simple family . fred schepisi  the director  selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy  while also showing the attentive bliss with which lindy  streep  and michael  sam neill  chamberlain care for their children .  br    br   while the famous line  a dingo took my baby   has become somewhat of a punchline these days  the movie never even comes close to laughable . the actual death of azaria is horrifyingly captured . it is subtle and realistic  leaving the audience horrified and asking questions .  br    br   the majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the chamberlain  s continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court  which suspects lindy of murder .  br    br   the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping . as an audience member  i was fully invested in the chamberlain  s plight . . . and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media . but at the same  the media  public opinion is understandable . i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic  but they always had valid reasons to hold their views .  br    br   the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas .  br    br   in terms of performances  the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and neill . . . and they deliver in every way . for me  this ranks as one of  if not    meryl streep  s best performances . for all her mastery of different accents  which of course are very impressive in their own right   streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters . i find this to be one of streep  s more subtle performances  and she hits it out of the park . and neill  an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park  is a perfect counterpoint to streep  s performance . from what i  ve seen  this is undoubtedly neill  s finest work to date . it  s a shame he wasn  t recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match streep  s . . . b  c the two of them play of each other brilliantly .  br    br   more emotionally gripping than most films  and also incredibly suspenseful . . . a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations . i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams  the dingo took my baby   watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line .  br    br   . . . a . . .  \n",
      "fascinating movie  based on a true story  about an australian woman  lindy chamberlain  meryl streep  accused of killing her baby daughter . she insists that a dingo took her baby  but the story is highly suspicious . the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case  the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media  and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman  s conviction  based on barely any hard evidence . i love films that question the media  and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system . i  ve always thought that juries ought to be showed   angry men before they go through with their duties . it  s not  as has often been said  a liberal movie  but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge . a cry in the dark is likewise clinical . schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic . some may find the film boring or dry  but i found it engaging .  \n",
      "in august     the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation . the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood . what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice .  br    br   michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock  central australia  that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area . no  one believed them . lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael as an accessory after the fact . the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing . the chamberlain  s trial was over before it began .  br    br   lindy never proved her innocence  so she was found guilty . there was never enough evidence to convict her  yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure . how could we as a nation even sit in judgement  from where we are  how could we possibly presume to know  unless there was absolute proof  and no reasonable doubt whatsoever  the chamberlains should have been acquitted .  br    br   fred schepisi  s film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson  s novel  that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them . that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock .  br    br   schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation  hell bent on  the truth  being brought to light . he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay  his screenplay  co  written with robert caswell  vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred .  br    br   the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts . she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight . even her accent is almost  but not quite  spot on . a very good effort by the master of that trade . sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart  and he starts to question his christianity . his  as was streep  s  is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly . the entire support cast are also excellent  with some of australia  s finest actors and actresses playing a part .  br    br   technically the film is brilliant too  with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour  especially the rock  . editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged  while bruce smeaton provides a telling score .  br    br   for all aussies this is a must see  a shocking look in the mirror if you will  at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served  and the truth to be known . as michael chamberlain said   i don  t think anybody really understands what innocence means . . . . . to innocent people .   br    br   saturday  may         video  br    br   even on return viewings fred schepisi  s account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains  who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in      is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving .  br    br   schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson  s novel to the screen  telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain  whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down .  br    br   amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby  and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact . what followed was little more than trial by media  and with the australian people determined she be put away  lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour  even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence .  br    br   meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence . she is truly awesome  and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent  though she does her level best to sound ocker . you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn  t cast in the role  but star power is probably the answer . alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill  outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes  while he feels powerless to do anything about it . a strong aussie cast lend compelling support .  br    br   editing from jill bilcock is very timely  ian baker  s cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton  s music is perfect for the part . truly a must for all conscientious australians .  br    br   sunday  june         video  \n",
      "i found it hard to like anyone in this film . the central characters  lindy and michael chamberlain  whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback  are not bad people  but then surely not all  or even most  of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better . but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life  s tragic disarray  the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip  news media  crowds  mobs and assumptions . it  s not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular it  s merely an account of a true story that happened there . society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are .  br    br   when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine  s dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog  when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines  newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy  there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one  s own unaware perceptions  influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one  s life . the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out  from the victims to the masses .  br    br   the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside  suspicion was jet  fueled mostly by a virtue of hers . to the public eye  she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter . why was she able to keep her cool  even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up  for tv and the press  how much of the downward spiral could  ve been prevented had she behaved more to the public  s liking in the media  meryl streep  one of  if not the  greatest actress working today  may not give a performance that particularly stands out  and frankly neither does any other actor  or department of film  making . but she  and the screenwriters  do understand lindy . what is infuriating is that it  s not that difficult . apparently  she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case . whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense  we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation .  br    br   whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie  s choice  the devil wears prada  angels in america or other such work  it is a triumph . it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself . she frustrates us because we don  t know what she  s thinking or feeling . it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her  but this is the movie  s way of suggesting the reaction of the public  s attention .  br    br   she is married to a pastor  and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most . initially  they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god  s will  kick  starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter  s death was some sort of ritual killing on their part . whatever happened to the little girl  her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media  s intake didn  t immediately identify  so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry . . . well . . .  br    br   meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen  but the australian public plays the real leads here . like punctuation for each plot advance  director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office  where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections .  br    br   this golan  globus docudrama is not particularly memorable . the setting  s atmosphere doesn  t give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out . but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public .  \n",
      "i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story . several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie . the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself . the cast just makes it that much more appealing . meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture . she nails mrs . chamberlain  s mannerisms  the accent  and even look . she shows the pain  hurt  surprise  and anger that lindy had to endure  and in the process it  s hard to remember that it isn  t lindy . in my opinion  this performance of meryl  s was better than her oscar  winning turn in  sophie  s choice   and should have garnered her her third oscar . sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain  and for some surprising reason  wasn  t recognized by the academy with at least a nomination . in all  this movie only receive one oscar nod  streep  s for best actress .  however  it did receive several australian oscars and nominations .  br    br   definitely a top  rate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast .  \n",

      "spoilers following i picked up the book  evil angels  when it first came out knowing nothing of the case . just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here  i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain  s guilt . the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did . john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors  and picked up by the press  of the arterial spray  the actelone     plates  dr . james cameron  s certainty that the collar was cut with scissors  that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up  bloody hand print  etc . all quite convincingly . after all  these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie  and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn  t apparent to me at all . it was also highly technical evidence  difficult for a layman to understand . to this point  beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials  hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human people didn  t believe it was possible . the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists  whose origins made them appear to be a cult  and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt . were it not for dedicated  selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony  finding azaria  s clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail . the book shook me for that reason  and i  ve been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone  s guilt ever since  excepting oj of course  . i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don  t think it could have been done better . i  ve always liked sam  who i could identify with completely  and meryl was perfect as always . beautiful photography  haunting music . i think it  s not only a very good  but a very important  movie . too bad it didn  t receive more publicity at the time it was released .  \n",

      "watch on the rhine is one of the best anti  nazi propaganda films made during world war two . paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar . bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was . i would recommend this film to those interested in that era  and  of course  the fabulous films of the late  great  ms . bette davis .  \n",

      "the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself  almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film . alexander korda nearly went broke making this film .  br    br   according to the citadel film series book about the great british films  adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as     and spent years of planning and preparation . but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle .  br    br   budget costs happen in us films too  only cecil b . demille always had a free hand at paramount after     when he returned there . but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film . part of the way through the shoot  korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon . he certainly wasn  t going to get scenery like that in the uk . korda also finished the interiors in hollywood  all in time for a release on christmas day     .  br    br   the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography  best artset direction for a color film  and best special effects . only miklos rosza  s original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category . korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it  s impossible to get bad color pictures from that place .  br    br   the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil . the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart  both belonging to duprez . this was veidt  s career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser .  br    br   of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source . beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star . literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features . sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant . not a bad message to be sending out in     at that .  br    br   the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today . it  s an eternal tale of love  romance  and adventure in any order you want to put it .  \n",

      "this was a favorite of my childhood  i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time . now that i  m grown up and have a kid of my own  i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie . we watched it last friday  and he liked it . during abu  s fight with the giant spider  my son  s hand crept over and took hold of mine  he was genuinely scared .  is he gonna beat the spider  poppa   just watch  you  ll see . he has no historical frame of reference to speak of  eight years old   so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al  raschid might as well be oz under ozma .  br    br   i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring  do were perpetrated by the boy  thief  and not the grown  up king . in fact  if you deconstruct the film  s narrative a bit  the king is the thief  s sidekick  not the hero at all  which must be very satisfying to imaginative  adventurous young boys .  br    br   it  s definitely a period piece  i suspect that by the time he  s eleven or twelve  my son will find it  corny  or whatever word the next generation will be using by then . the love story is barely one  dimensional  as a cynical friend commented   why does ahmad love the princess  because the narrative demands it .  the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy  repeatedly  for the clueless  love  struck deposed king is equally improbable . but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses  fifty  foot genies and the temple of the all  seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme . the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie  s climax is tremendous  as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his  stolen  magic carpet  seeking  some fun  and adventure at last    \n",
      "i have seen this film several times  and watched it today  on tcm  solely because of geraldine fitzgerald . she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her  probably in  wuthering heights    or more years ago  . the real star in this movie  however  is paul lukas  and he deserved all the accolades he got . he makes it clear  whether we like it or not  that the end justifies the means . naziism had to be stopped  and anything that helped do it was good . he gave his children a line about being bad  and that they should not be bad  but as he said earlier when conversing with adults  he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation . lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation  and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do .  br    br   some people think his victim was a nazi  but i don  t think so  i think he was only after the money . his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him .  br    br   one interesting point in the film  and presumably also in the play  is the fact that muller  lucas  is a german . while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii  there was considerable anti  german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry . it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time  maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi  soviet pact   . after all  the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians . i think  however  that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later  after  watch on the rhine  was released .  br    br   the title is something of a play on words  as the  watch  is looking west  from germany . in fact  watch am rhein was a german army marching song  used in wwii  but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well . but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own  wach am rhein  .  br    br   all the other actors did an excellent job here although bodo was too much there are children like him . i am surprised he did not give his father  s secret away . in real life  he may very well have done so .  \n",

      "this film  was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that  unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it  s quality while i grew up . this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children  it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well . the only drawback there is  is that one can not see past the bad  effects  compared to the effects nowadays  like one could when one was a child . i remembered nothing of those effects  of course it had been about ten years since i  d seen this film  when i was about eleven years old . who then watches effects  one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides . in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the   th century . coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film . there is comedy  romance and adventure all in one  which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern  it succeeds in not being dusty and old . all of that is mainly due to the great story  the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors . in that department sabu  as abu  and conrad veidt  as jaffar  stand out  providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part . great film and although an  oldie   definitely a goldie  . i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday .  br    br    out of    \n",

      "the story  line of  the thief of bagdad  is complex  owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together . the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points . the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas . he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar  s deeds and hate him . he is imprisoned by jaffar  where he meets abu the young thief . the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra . there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by . ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden . he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss . then he is captured . when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself  ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog . jaffar then asks for the princess  s hand  and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra . the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace  accompanied by abu as his dog . the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her . so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog  in hopes the prince can rouse her . he does awaken her . she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad  but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard . she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms  on his promise to restore ahmad  s sight and turn abu back into a thief . the princess sees a vision of ahmad he is in a boat jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island . abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle . abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel  then corks him in again . for freeing him  he gets three wishes . his first is for sausages . in the meanwhile  the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy  one of whose six arms stabs him to death . abu makes a second wish  to find ahmad . the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all  seeing eye . abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye  battling a giant spider  then scaling the goddess  s statue . abu gazes into the  eye  and sees ahmad in a canyon . he has the genie take him to ahmad . ahmad uses the eye to see the princess . she smells a flower and forgets everything at once . abu wishes they were in bagdad  but the genie laughs and leaves jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him  omitting mention of ahmad . ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess  but jaffar smashes the  eye  . abu finds himself in the  land of legend   where the old men who rule want to make him their king . he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead  to hurry to save ahmad and the princess . the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner  using his bow from the flying carpet  to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution . jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse  but another shot from the bow finishes him . ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess but when he tries to make abu his vizier  the young thief refuses  saying that what he wants is adventure  not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be . this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda . the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director  while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography . the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell  with tim whelan  alexander korda  william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating . the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong  oliver messel and marcel vertes . the production  apart from its gorgeous and expensive  looking visual splendors  i claim is dominated by two other elements  the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar . rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent  plus his usual intelligence and power . june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima  and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan . as ahmad  john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some he is memorably good in his winning role . this film has a spaciousness about it that is found  i assert  in other korda works also . its imaginative content stands in contrast to very  strong realistic sets  costumes and set  design elements . this is one of the most memorable idea  level fantasies of all time  worthy to be enjoyed over and over .  \n",

      "watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non  aggression pact signed in august of     . so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line  the line didn  t change until a couple of months later . lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work .  br    br   the play watch on the rhine ran from april     to february     for    performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler  eric roberts as the youngest son  lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas .  br    br   lukas pulled an award hat trick in     winning an oscar  a golden globe  and the new york film critics for best actor . probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well . the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against  humphrey bogart for casablanca  gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls  mickey rooney in the human comedy  and walter pidgeon for madame curie . every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was . lukas  s nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field .  br    br   jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas  s wife was given to bette davis . davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her  but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it . it  s the same reason she did the man who came to dinner  a much lighter play than this one .  br    br   davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days . after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe  davis lukas  and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war . they  re made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren .  br    br   the fly in this ointment are some other house guests  a friend of davis  s from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe  a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris . coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas  s anti  fascist background .  br    br   his suspicions are quite correct  it  s the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they  ve become . lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there . his health has not been the same since . his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes . those decisions affect all the other members of the cast .  br    br   adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman  s significant other . coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell  kurt katch  clyde fillmore  erwin kalser and rudolph anders .  br    br   coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count . he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad .  br    br   lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in      but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls . dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti  fascist classic  casablanca .  br    br   though it  s an item firmly planted in those specific times  watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti  fascist message that bears repeating infinitely .  \n",

      "i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago . having saw it twice  i couldn  t help but missing before sunrise  not because the sequel was not as great  but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did  every time i finished watching one of them  i feel the need and yearning to see the other . so  i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly  i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly . the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other . it sounds so simple  the growing of the chemistry  i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development  but to me  who doesn  t believe in nora ephron  before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it . when i saw it for the first time  about  year ago when i was    i already liked it . but  i didn  t rate it as a  great film   it still seemed to me like another thinking persons  feel good movie  linklater was too smart to make it more realistic  it was   minutes too long  the characters was too well fabricated  i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations  etc . etc . . but now  thanks to before sunset  i feel that  s more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before . i saw the elements more clearly jesse  celine  vienna  their conversations  everything . how each of them are separated element by itself  and they have a chance to mix  the story is just a frame of time  i am no longer feel manipulated . and the freedom that every scene has  as well as its refusal to be overly efficient  how blind i was that those qualities didn  t strike me as exceptional when i first saw it  now   year have passed  the more movies i  ve seen  the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending  even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters  s own slackers included . the jesse and celine tale avoid that  maybe before sunset is a better example in this case  but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time  not a destination  every single scene has its own life . i don  t know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise  but to me  one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other . before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes  seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine  the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it . meanwhile  i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset  and celine  s first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i  ve seen in a beginning of a film  and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don  t know with a sadness in me  no matter how beautiful paris is  and no matter how happy i am that they meet again . i  m sorry that i go on this long with my limited english  before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts  and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it .  \n",
      "i  m not even sure what to say about this film . it  s one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic . to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa  like dancing about architecture  . it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again . this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write . the ending is left open and ambiguous  no happy ending here  just mystery . no profound life lessons  just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings . . . . . . romantic love .  br    br     out of   watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n",

      "after a chance encounter on the train  a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna  discussing life and love . the primary reason to see  before sunrise   is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines . as  celine   this sexy  brainy  soulful brown  eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid  twenties . risking overstatement  celine is practically the ideal woman  unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural  unpretentious  introspective  and selflessly loving . we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak  for her sincere  intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating . further  her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing .  br    br   if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie  it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar . ethan hawke as  jessie  comes off like a vaguely appealing slob  sort of a maynard g . krebs of the nineties . attempting to appear detached and nonchalant  he sort of drags himself through certain shots . his pants fit poorly  his tee shirt is coming untucked  his wavy dark hair  his most attractive feature  needs a good washing  and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee . nevertheless  he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two  week train ride around europe  so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine . his oft  cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine  although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation . when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence  we know he is getting somewhere .  br    br   after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes  bars  and silly diversions  they agree that because they may never see one another again  they should make the most of it . jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass  looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up .  br    br   given his boundless luck in the romance department  it is especially irksome when jessie  as the very definition of a naive jerk  foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp . he contents himself with a half  baked plan  quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu  to reunite at the same spot in half a year . when the appointed time comes  you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another  perhaps even married and pregnant . for whatever reason  she probably won  t show  while jesse  who ends up working at target or  if he  s lucky  the local library  will go back to vienna  desperate to see her again  only to wind up alone .  br    br   despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion   before sunrise  is a beautiful movie . i highly recommend both it and the sequel   before sunset .   \n",
      "when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in     via a free advanced screening  i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it . i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended . i  on the other hand  felt completely the opposite . i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else . people i talked to said there was too much talking  plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters . i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie  going public seems to have a tendency to want easy  to  follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused . they also like to be spoon  fed tidy endings   happy or sad . this disgusts me . nobody wants to be challenged anymore    and as for the ending  and i don  t want to be a spoiler   i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again . it  s all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny . it  s a very personal film that doesn  t speak to all people . but it certainly spoke to me . give it a chance  be patient with it  richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna . watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters . as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass . it  s very intimate . plus  ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life . they must have improvised during some parts and it works well . they have a great chemistry in their roles . their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses . i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr . linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made . it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much . bravo for romance     \n",

      "before sunrise has many remarkable things going on  almost too many to fit into one review like this  but it  s suffice to say that it  s one of the most observant character studies of the nineties  maybe even in all of contemporary cinema  to be observant not about love  per  say  so much as it  s about a human connection . how does one fall in love at first sight  no one does  at least that  s deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film . and yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection  of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time . linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie  a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna  and on the way there start to talking about things  at first arbitrary  then personal  jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather  . jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the  town   in vienna  until his plane the next morning .  br    br   before sunrise gives jessie and celine  in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance  and in a sense is about the act of having conversations  of what it  s like to watch people having one leading into another and another . here it  s often about relationships and commitments  as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential  or seemingly so  and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities . we hear confessions of desires for other loves  or what weren  t really loves  of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you  ll love your life  of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form  or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul  i loved the bit about the quakers in the church   and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism . jessie may be more responsible for that last part  but what  s fascinating about the film is that it  s never exactly cynical itself  just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives .  br    br   meanwhile  it  s always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles  where they  re not incessantly annoying in that   s generation  x mode  but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film  which isn  t a bad one at all but a necessary one  one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere . the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter  only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other  where sweet asides are actually acceptable   i have to tell you a secret   jessie says  and then leans in for a kiss  ho  ho   or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way . i loved the scene with the poet  where it  s very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal  or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share  but really are seeing them do it first  hand . all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly  we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives  as it may lead off into the future . . .  br    br   featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness  however self  contained  as it may lead into something more . who  s to say you can  t suddenly be attached to someone  if only for less than   hours  and be that much more attached than a married couple  this is perhaps linklater  s thesis  but there  s more to it than just that . it  s a very dense film  and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly . one scene especially  which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking  on the phone  in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other  s friend . a  \n",

      "many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with  the mortal storm  or  casablanca  . everyone is entitled to compare films they choose  but the similarities of  the mortal storm  and  watch on the rhine  are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut  while the main comparative point brought out with  casablanca  is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in     by the academy of motion picture arts and science  because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar . it does not strike me as totally wrong . lukas had a good career in film  both here and in england  he is the villain in  the lady vanishes    and this performance was his best one . bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine  for instance  he was ignored for sam spade in  the maltese falcon  and roy earle in  high sierra  two years earlier  both of which were first rate performances  and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c . dobbs in  the treasure of sierra madres   the writer  murder suspect in  in a lonely place   and captain philip francis queeg in  the caine mutiny  afterward  he got it for charley in  the african queen   . i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs  but it did not happen . but lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career . few can claim that .  br    br   to me the film to look at with  watch on the rhine  is based on another play  script by hellman   the searching wind  . they both look at america  s spirit of isolationism in the     s and     s .  the searching wind  is really looking at the whole inter  war period  while  watch on the rhine   set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii  deals with a few weeks of time . therefore it is better constructed as a play  and more meaningful for it  s impact .  br    br   the film has many good performances  led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti  nazi fighter  courier  davis as his loyal wife  wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play  s activities   coulouris as the selfish  conniving  but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck  lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald  as coulouris  wiser and sadder and fed up wife   and kurt katch  who delivers a devastating critique  as the local embassy  s gestapo chief  about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis . it has dialog with bite in it . and what it says is quite true . it also has moments of near poetry . witness the scene  towards the end  when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis  and says   the new world has left the scene to the old world  . hellman could write very well at times .  br    br   given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films .  \n",

      "before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation . richard linklater  s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people . the film depicts romance in all it  s glory  but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that  s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to  with just one problem  the problem of time . while most relationships wind down with time  this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out . before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental  hollywood romance   which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders . the story follows two people  jesse an american and celine a french girl that meet on a train into vienna . they instantly connect  and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train  jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna . . .  br    br   before sunrise works principally for two reasons  realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life . this allows the characters to be free  and it  s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script . this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are  and not merely because they  re the protagonists . this kind of realism is hard to capture as  at the end of the day  we as the audience know that they  re watching a film and not observing real life but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen . a truly great script cannot work on it  s own  and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice  and although i  m not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke on viewing this film  there is nothing you can do but give them both respect . i don  t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves  but when a film is this good it hardly matters .  br    br   in a film like this  it is the writing that  s the most important thing  and contained within the script are several observations about life  most of which i personally could relate to . this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters  but it also manages to expose what true love is  along with several other aspects of life . the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing . everyone is different  and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people . there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and that  s the case with the musings in this script . adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna . the city itself isn  t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere  but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat  energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location .  br    br   before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating . richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental . before sunrise is what it is . and what it is  is pure cinematic brilliance .  \n",

      "when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas  its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film . yet  having read the content  i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie . the effect surprised me totally i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me . a vow to cherish is  without any doubt  one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema . here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema .  br    br   first  the entire content is particularly educational . it has something to offer to the modern audience  pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions . is there a need for christ in our times  does love still matter  what for is there faith  what is the logics of burden and suffering in life  is there really someone by my side i can always trust  the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us .  br    br   second  the movie is exceptionally humane . the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions . is it better for kyle david denman  and teri  megan paul  to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home  is it better for john  ken howard  to leave ellen  barbara babcock   his sick wife  and start a new happy life with julia  donna bullock   a woman he falls in love with  in fact  ellen no longer recognizes him . . . yet  he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity . had john  s rebellious brother  phil  d . david morin   better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life . phil  s prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity . these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where  when or how they live .  br    br   third  the movie is a great portrayal of family  not very popular nowadays there are problems  yet  there is always something more powerful that gets these people together . this  something  is love and trust . i know that it may seem a bit idealistic . not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that . nevertheless  it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one .  br    br   fourth  the entire film focuses on people  s mutual help . if we want to live happy lives in our society  we must understand one thing we have to help one another . alexander  ossie davis  is an example of such attitude . at the beginning of the movie  we see him talk to john about praying . later  he helps his brother . alexander is a kinda  angel  that is sent to john and his family . isn  t it possible that we may become angels to one another   br    br   fifth  the artistic features are also worth attention . performances barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role  she does a perfect job . consider  for instance  the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again . ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband . picture the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves  autumn  while the sunshine  love  spreads everywhere . i interpreted as a sort of symbol even if there is sorrow  this can always be illuminated by light and joy . . .  br    br   a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love  what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe . at the end  i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do  br    br   kyle to his uncle phil yes  he  john brighton  lives according to the bible . but nobody forces you to do so . yet  according to what rules do you live   \n",

      "i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy  i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business . . . who are now still trying to become adults . . . . no more fans  groupies  money etc . . . and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life . . . as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight . . . it is almost like they have to begin anew . . . this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the    s and    s are going through now . . . . and that  s where i find the film sad and depressing . but it portrays the life of an old rock star  abandoned and lost  in a believable way . the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren  outrageous  . . . and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for . this film is a must have for folks in their    s who have seen the rise and fall of bands  people who knew the members  and have watched them hurt as age creeps in  and popularity fades . this is an almost perfect movie . . . . sad but in a way positive . . . . because of the whales . a must see   \n",

      "i was amazingly impressed by this movie . it contained fundamental elements of depression  grief  loneliness  despair  hope  dreams and companionship . it wasn  t merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music . he finds a companion who comes with her own issues . claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst .  br    br   des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star . yet he has musical genius . he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate  while things around him literally go to ruins . his focus is creating his whale music  in fact it becomes an obsession for him .  br    br   claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay . she finds hidden talents while being in des company . she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her . she learns to trust him over a period of time .  br    br   these two find love with one another . not the mind blowing  sex infused kind of passion  but a love where friendship and understanding means more . for two people who have been hurt  they find trust together .  \n",
      "a friend of mine recommended this movie  citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl  the movie  s main character . i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more  i  m not very sure whether or not that  s flattering portrayal .  br    br   this is a pretty unique work  the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance  not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue  whale music is just so much more  well  relaxed .  but instead that they both represent modern love stories .  br    br   in general i  m a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians  for example i highly recommend hard core logo  and this film in particular . it has an innocent charm  des is not always the most likeably guy  but there  s something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy .  \n",
      "my first exposure to  whale music  was the rheostatics album of the same name  that i bought around     . i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album  which remains in a prominent place in my collection  was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington  s book .  br    br   i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it  an amazing read  i have since re  read the book numerous times  each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music .  br    br   i found the film in      on video . i haven  t had a lot of good experiences with canadian film  but this one worked for me . the role of claire could have been cast differently  but overall i think that paul quarrington  s vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen .  br    br   maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius . the movie deals with family relationships  love  and finding someone who understands . i would strongly recommend  whale music  to not only music fans  but anyone who has ever lost something or someone  and tried to find their way back to the world .  \n",

      "i saw it last night on tv  and was quite delighted .  br    br   it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart  and believe that there is still some goodness in the world  all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her  the old policeman is my favourite   although you know that this story is not quite realistic .  br    br   i loved acting  they all seemed just as ordinary  common people  living in small picturesque english coast town  but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has  just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their  tea     br    br   perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing  but it didn  t stop me from really  really enjoying the whole story   \n",
      "  saving grace  is never riotously funny  but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree . brenda blethyn is a fine actress  and does a good job at portraying widower grace  who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts . the supporting cast also does a fine job . french actor tchecky karyo has a funny little role . the premise alone is appealing . the idea of an over  the  hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough . and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then . of course  there are flat moments  like one where two elderly women mistaken grace  s marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work . that was a mindless gag that didn  t quite take off . the film  s tone is downbeat and occasionally dull  but i got enough laughs to give this english import a recommendation .  br    br   my score   out of     \n",
      "saving grace is a feel good movie with it  s heart in the right place . grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts . she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana . she  s living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors . there  s only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it  s user . it  s obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff . the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny . it  s precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick  and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable .  \n",

      "this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value . it gets quite hysterically funny at times  but if you haven  t spent any time on  that  side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts .  br    br   the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles . how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played . she  s a true lady . and  my favorite is grace  s white pimp suit that she wears .  br    br   i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud  who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different .  \n",
      "for muslim women in western africa  married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard . the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour  but equally  they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal  an attitude which of course enables it to continue . fortunately  the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all  and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children . what is notable  apart from the uplifting central story  is how  in spite of their informality  the courts are actually pragmatically progressive  if a case is actually bought . the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life  style  which  aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases  seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america . and while i concede that this comment may betray naivet on my part  this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin  english they speak . overall  this is a terrific little film  and much more fun to watch than you might imagine .  \n",
      "yet another example of what british cinema can achieve a simple story  told and acted well . brenda blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened grace  ably assisted by a solid supporting cast . the  quirky small town  card gets played to the hilt  similar to many tv series and films that have come from the british isles in recent years  ballykissangel  hamish macbeth and others come to mind  . like the forementioned  this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery  in this case the wet and wild cornish coast .  br    br   some viewers might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging  others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe . but it  s an enjoyable spliff  to be sure .  \n",
      "a delightful gentle comedic gem  until the last five minutes  which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce . the last five minutes cost it  points in my rating . despite this major plot and style flaw  it  s worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting . many fine little bits to savor  like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit card . . . made more piquant when we  re not  quite  sure the card is not maxed .  \n",

      "one of the funnest mario  s i  ve ever played . the levels are creative  there are fluid controls  and good graphics for its time . there  s also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight . sometimes the levels get frustrating  and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still  need to get more accomplished to fight a boss  it can be annoying . another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time  it can be a pain in certain situations . if your a big time mario fan this ones for you . even if your not a huge fan of him  i  d still recommend this one . its a big game  and getting what you need can take a while  but it  s very satisfying . good for playing in short bursts of time . it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine   \n",

      "  emma  was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid  nineties  and it was recently shown on british television  doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with  pride and prejudice  two years ago . we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic  becoming jane   and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels . these include  northanger abbey   the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously  so the cycle should now be complete . no doubt  however  there will be more to come in the near future .  there is  after all  her juvenile  love and freindship   sic   the short novella  lady susan   and someone  somewhere  has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments  the watsons  and  sanditon  . then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers  .  br    br   the main character is emma woodhouse  a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england .  not  as some reviewers have assumed  victorian england  austen died before queen victoria was even born  . emma is  financially  considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price  and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband . instead  her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends . she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer  robert martin  believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton . this scheme goes disastrously wrong  however  as elton has no interest in harriet  but has fallen in love with emma herself . the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards  with good reason  as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself . this being a jane austen plot  emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems  and she too finds herself falling in love  leading to further complications .  br    br   emma always insists that she will not marry without affection  and when she does find a partner  the handsome mr knightley  we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage . it does not  however  seem likely to be a very passionate one  unlike  say  that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy  . knightley  who is sixteen years older than emma  she is    he     and related to her by marriage  is more like a father  figure than a lover . much more of a father  figure  in fact  than her actual father  a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather . when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates  it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners .  his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature  nineteenth  century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry  . both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well  but this is not really one of the great screen romances .  br    br   of the other characters  i liked juliet stephenson  s vulgar mrs elton and toni collette  s harriet . i know that in the novel harriet was a nave young teenager  whereas here she is more like the character collette played in  muriel  s wedding   a gauche  slightly overweight twentysomething  fretting about her chances of finding a man . nevertheless  i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen  s themes .  br    br    emma  is one of austen  s more light  hearted works  without the darker overtones of  mansfield park  or even  pride and prejudice   and this is reflected on screen . we see a world of beauty and grace  full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners . apart from the ruffianly gypsies  who make a very brief appearance  the only  poor  people we see are mrs bates and her daughter  and  as they live in the sort of picturesque rose  strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over          we can be sure that their poverty is relative  not absolute . in emma  s world  poverty is defined as not having your own stately home . this is  of course  not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth  century life  but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen  sink realist . sophisticated romantic comedy  combined with a keen eye for analysing human character  was more in her line .  br    br   i would not rate this film quite as highly as the      sense and sensibility  or the recent  pride and prejudice   it tends to drag a bit in the middle  although it has a strong beginning and strong ending  but it is  in the main  a highly enjoyable austen adaptation .      \n",

endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr . knightley  jeremy northam   whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma  s  and lend some needed balance to the proceedings . and emma  so concerned with what is right for others  neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all her own . the world goes round and love abounds  but emma is about to miss the boat . luckily for her  however  the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings . now  if she can but stop long enough to realize it . but as everyone who has known true love knows  matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant  depending upon the slightest thing and while romance is at hand for emma  she must first recognize it  and seize the moment .  br    br   mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful  feel  good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world . there may be an air of frivolity about it  but in retrospect  this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is   in all honesty   to just about anyone love . and with mcgrath  s impeccable sense of pace and timing  it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable . it  s a pleasant  affecting film  with a wonderful cast  that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place . it  s light fare  but absorbing and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well  being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow .  br    br   the winsome paltrow  who won the oscar for best actress for shakespeare in love  two years after making this one  seems comfortable and right at home in this genre . she personifies all things british  and does it with such naturalness and facility that it  s the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether . she  s simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy . she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner  very reminiscent of audrey hepburn . yet paltrow is unique . as an actor  she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated   with such films as hard eight   hush  and a perfect murder    that she can play just about any part effectively  and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own . but it  s with characters like emma that she really shines . she is so expressive and open  and her personality is so engaging  that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch  regardless of the part she is playing . and for emma  she is absolutely perfect .  br    br   jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley  and like paltrow  seems suited to the genre   in the right role  that is his performance in the more recent the golden bowl   in which he played an italian prince  was less than satisfying . here  however  he is perfect he is handsome  and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real . like colin firth  s mr . darcy in the miniseries pride and prejudice   northam has created a memorable character with his own mr . knightley .  br    br   also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette  as emma  s friend harriet smith and alan cumming  as the reverend elton . respectively  collette and cumming create characters who are very real people  and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film . and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema  and to films of any genre .  br    br   the supporting cast includes greta scacchi  mrs . weston   denys hawthorne  mr . woodhouse   sophie thompson  miss bates   kathleen byron  mrs . goddard   phyllida law  mrs . bates   polly walker  jane fairfax  and ewan mcgregor  frank churchill  . an uplifting  elegant film  emma  is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness . and even if it  s only through the magic of the silver screen  it  s nice to be able to escape to such a world as this  if only for a couple of hours  as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit . and that  s the magic of the movies . i rate this one     .  br    br    br    br    \n",
      "this is one of the best films i have seen in years  i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan  but she is excellent as emma woodhouse . alan cumming is superb as reverand elton  and emma thompson  s sister  sophie  is hysterical as miss bates . and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr . knightley what a gentleman  whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma . i think that is what separates it from so many others   it  s classy .  br    br   if you  re looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family  or looking for a romance for yourself  look no further . emma is that movie . with a beautiful setting  wonderful costumes  and an outstanding cast  have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam    emma is a perfect ten   \n",
      "i was so impressed with doug mcgrath  s film version of the jane austen novel  emma   and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much  that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re  united for  nicholas nickleby  i immediately rented it without any other consideration .  br    br   i have read the book  and for those overly  critical fans of this jane austen adaptation  i don  t know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen  s work  especially given the limitations of a two hour movie  which some have complained about being too long   . and as far as gwen paltrow  s accent is concerned  i must confess i wasn  t too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially  and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress   br    br   i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery . that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside . the film  s beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success . if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker  then perhaps you should rent something like  death wish iii    br    br   the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast  and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings . mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story .  br    br   this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex  violence or even a villainous antagonist . the story is often amusing  endearing  and at times  quite touching .  br    br   i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite .  \n",
      "by no means my favourite austen novel  and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress  but i found the film almost totally delightful . paltrow does a good job  and cummings  stevenson and the one who plays  miss bates  are all absolutely terrific . the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right  in fact . but the real  find  is jeremy northam as mr knightley . there could not be more perfect casting  imo . i hated mr k in the novel  but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film . northam  s good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment  either  highly recommended . anar  \n",

      "tweaked a little bit   nothing  could be a children  s film . it  s a very clever concept  touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes  and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think of . . . what goes against everything more than  literally   nothing   nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives . all that  s left is what they don  t hate  and a big empty white space . it  s hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film  especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot . it focuses on pretty much one subject  but that  s prime vincenzo natali territory . if you  ve seen  cube   you know already that he tends to like that type of situation . the  nothing  in this movie is apparently infinite space  but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic  if only because there  s literally nothing else  and nowhere else to go . the actors sell it  although you can tell these guys are friends anyway . two actors from  cube  return here  worth and kazan   but are entirely different characters . they change throughout the story  and while they  re not the strongest actors in the world  they  re at least believable .  br    br   the reason i say this could be a children  s film under the right tweaks  is because aside from a few f  bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence  the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids . so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore  especially considering there isn  t very much of it . this could  ve gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue . there is very little objectionable about this film  but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it . i only say that  s a shame because not because i support censorship  but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure .  br    br   at any rate  this is a reasonably entertaining film  albeit with a few dragged  out scenes . but for literally being about nothing  and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing  they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film .  \n",

      "having seen cube  i  ve been a fan of vincenzo natali  s work . natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline  and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster . instead  he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways  so much in fact  that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape  or in the case of nothing  a large empty expanse where there is . . . nothing  the advert had me hooked instantly . it seemed so simple  take two characters who no one likes  and send them to a world where there is nothing . natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist . in fact  the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film . there  s nothing there  but also  something  there .  br    br   it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading . i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so . therefore upon watching the film  i laughed every now and again  whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused .  br    br   if i may take a minute to give the film some praise  where the film excels on is the concept . it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing  and to put two characters there  not two brilliant minded characters  who will philosophise and work out their surroundings  but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are  another strong point is the film  s cinematography  though at first this may not seem it  where each wall  north  earth  south  west  up and down is just a white plane  a perception of depth becomes faulty . it is hard to determine where things are placed in the mis  en  scene . the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens  but for the most part  the camera is placed so that two characters  or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background  allowing a sense of depth to be realised .  br    br   however  this film does lack in certain areas . the film is relatively short  but even so  after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull  and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot . we can also argue that the acting is once again  questionable . these two characters are in a sense  unlikeable  therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters . however  on a flip side of that  the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough  but there is something lacking .  br    br   even so  i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film  do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science  fiction horror film . it is much more of a comedy than that  it is indeed worth watching though  purely for the concept itself   \n",
      "i chanced upon this movie because i had a free non  new release from blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly  as the store was getting ready to close for the evening . the plain white cover and title intrigued me . i  m a  relatively speaking   old  lady and my son is a young man of   . i adore movies that are sheer entertainment  such as the sixth sense  interview with a vampire  harry potter and beetlejuice . my son  on the other hand  is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films  such as those directed by bergman or hertzog . we generally hate each other  s movie choices  however  we both watched and loved the movie nothing  it was unlike any movie we  d ever seen before . we  re both cynical  critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them   but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish . it is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the u . s . it would have done very well indeed .  \n",
      "i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film  and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed . it made much of the fact that the film was  by the director of cube  and made it look like a horror film  when in fact it is an absurdist comedy  imdb  s spell checker doesn  t seem to think that absurdist is a word  but it is   reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead .  br    br   i love the way the story builds up slowly at first  then gradually escalates . i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film . that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube . i recommend it .  \n",
      "director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for character  based sci  fi flicks with his     short film  elevated   wherein  people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building . his follow  up feature project  cube   released later that year  had a very similar premise  this time with  people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps . both were admirable attempts to take the sci  fi genre a step further  by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation  choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element  how the characters act  react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions . after his exploration into the mainstream with      s  cypher   natali has come back to his bizarre character  film trend to bring us  nothing   his latest  and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of  what if    br    br   dave  david hewlett  and andrew  andrew miller  are life  long friends  brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with . dave  who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature  lives rent  free with andrew at his ill  located and ill  constructed house  where he often takes advantage of andrew  s neurotic and antisocial mentality . despite all this  the two misfits are happy together  until one day their deep character flaws  coupled with some astronomically bad luck  land them in the middle of some pretty serious  jail  sentence  worthy trouble . on top of this  they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset  so in the hazy  nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them  they wish that the whole world would just disappear . and it does .  br    br   going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film  s slow  occasionally too slow  reveal about what  s happened to dave and andrew  and how they deal with their new reality . natali  s fascination with studying human behavior under duress  ala the birds  is here in spades  but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers  he  s able to break away from the thriller  horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level . it  s almost as if he  s made the aphoristic opposite of  cube  .  br    br   of course  the film is not   minutes of laughter and sunshine . in keeping with fundamental realism  our two anti  heroes  dynamic often becomes antagonistic  sometimes with rather nasty results . like the  desert island  game  the film looks at how even best friends  when left alone together  can fall apart  but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence . in a very twisted  sci  fi way  this is a feel  good flick  with good heart and good intentions .  br    br   however  there are a few qualms to be had with  nothing  . while the two lead actors  hewlett and miller  do well with their parts  their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been  considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour . there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew  some background is given  but ultimately not enough . a generous viewer will sit through the less  engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end  but cynics will probably give up pretty fast .  br    br   acting  as mentioned  is adequate  and considering the amount of  green  screen  work that would  ve been needed  reasonably convincing . david hewlett and andrew miller  who both wrote co  wrote the screenplay  have been long  time friends of vincenzo natali hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made . perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction . nonetheless  the story could have been a lot more involving . granted  it is relatively entertaining considering that  no pun intended  nothing really happens  but you get the impression that  in more experienced hands  a lot more could  ve been done with this premise .  br    br   in all fairness   nothing  is an impressive piece of work in many ways . the concept is interesting  the direction is inventive  the script works on a human level and  most of all  it shows a progression in natali  s creative mentality . for fans of his work  this will be a delight  and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time . it  s just a shame that the director  s fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great  fun film it could have been .  \n",

      "nothing    outta  stars  another weird premise from the director of the movie  cube  . this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void . there is literally nothing outside of their small two  story house . intriguing to be sure  but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get  go was extremely ill  conceived . there needs to be some humour  certainly . . . and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes  their final  showdown  was definitely a hoot  . . . but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning . after watching the movie i watched the  making of  feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the  sillier  comedic aspects . . . making it look like a completely different  and slightly better  movie . the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together . . . similar in a way to the recent movie  primer .  the actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick . they are really quite believable in their more  normal  moments . i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point . . . but it won me over by the end .  and keep watching past the credits for the final scene . . . just don  t ask me to explain it .   \n",
      "the premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now . we  ve all heard or read about it in some kind of con  text . what would you do if you were all alone in the world  what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes  in fact  the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew  two room  mates living in a run  down house in the middle of a freeway system . andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society . that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along  because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed . just until . . .  br    br   straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them . both of them get involved with crime  andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn  t dare going out of the house . dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues don  t treat him very well and with the respect he deserves . the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it . this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away . . . and of course that is exactly what happens .  br    br   the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness . at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment  but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left .  br    br   nothing features an incredibly small cast  in fact  besides the first couple of shots from the film  we only see dave  david hewlett  and andrew  andrew miller  in the entire film . it is clear that in order to pull this off  the cast has to be more than up for the task  because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way . vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close  up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well . director of photography  derek rogers  also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information  especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it  but we don  t see it right away .  br    br   obviously  this can  t be an event driven film and it  s not . much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void . and that  s where some of the most hilarious scenes take place  especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy bar .  br    br   now  one could be thinking  how does nothing look like   well  it looks like nothing indeed . the entire world of nothing is white . . . white no matter in what direction you look . this is the weakness of this film . . . after an hour or less it  s getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it  s more interesting to look at . thank god  there are some . for example at times when the two lads  due to the properties of nothing  are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of . . . tofu  as andrew claims  . it  s fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society .  br    br   one of the best parts of the film is the set . . . production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film  the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at  still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this . all in all  the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching . . .  br    br   however  the very best part of the film is the acting . both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are . the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said  there are just about no props in the film  they are really on a bare stage . with plenty of character development and some decent one  liners  clever dialogue  at times hilariously stupid   it all works to that end  and this really moves the movie away from the low  budget area to well  crafted handwork .  br    br   let  s talk a little about the visual effects  because they are definitely worth mentioning . nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film . there  s a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film  and although the drews have milked that scene completely it  s still fun to watch . one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment  they have the abilities to wish everything away  so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear   br    br    nothing  is a bright and well  lit movie  it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead  this is in fact one of their theories   but  nothing  is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory . we don  t know where they are or what has happened to them . we don  t know if they will ever get out  because the movie ends before we see anything like that . the ending  by the way  is not as good as it could  ve been . it  s rather easy to predict what is going to happen  still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end  it  s a reasonably satisfactory one .  br    br   take  hollow man    kill bill    cube    epoch  and lots of other films and you have  nothing  . it really is an amalgam of different styles  still there is no other film  at least that i know of  nothing is really like . for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube . he talks about him and andr bijelic having been room  mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out   nothing  could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story  and to that end  it  s almost like one of the cube prequels .  br    br   what can i say  i enjoyed  nothing   it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well  made with tons of intelligent ideas  still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is . . . maybe if we have a  nothing   i can answer that question .  nothing  is a great film  but not as good as i expected it to be .  br    br   final rating  .      \n",
      "i wasn  t sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this . a smart  slightly twisted comedy that makes you think . i wasn  t quite sure how a director can create  nothing   but leave it to mr . natali and the brilliant individuals at c . o . r . e . to create another low budget set that looks real  as real as nothing can be  . well worth your time and money  if you have the opportunity to see this  please go . you  ll be glad you did .  \n",

      "wow . . . what . . . a whirlwind . the    s is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine  especially during the early talkies phase . there were movies which are painfully static and dull  like  dracula  with bella lugosi  and there were those that just don  t give it a rest  sometimes in a good way and other times not . this is one of the films that don  t stop for a minute  and that is both a wonder and a pity . lloyd bacon  who also directed    nd street   must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema  for he filled this picture with it . there mustn  t be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking . it  s completely crazy  i was thinking the movie deserved a   or a   tops  because the pacing was very poor  since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn  t know what was happening and what to think . the characters seemed to just running to and fro places  talking about things which didn  t interest me and probably no one else . i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache . i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in    nd street   ruby keeler  and    nd street  was a movie whose ending was the best part of it . and you know what  it happened the same thing with  footlight parade   the ending is absolutely incredible  it has become  hands down  the most impressive musical i have ever seen . the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are  believe me  something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth . the numbers are flawless  there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one . suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work  beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache .  \n",

      "in     dick powell and ruby keeler sang and danced their way through three warner brother musicals that offered depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes . gold diggers of        nd street and footlight parade were all set in the world of broadway theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on . in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley  show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players .  br    br   all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it  s pace energy and lead james cagney . warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in   nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads  particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash . both lack the infectious energy of cagney however  who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical . he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers  unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend .  br    br   of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is . the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh  hugh herbert  guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size . busby berkeley  s dance numbers are surreal  suggestive and risqu and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in   . sadly  the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of footlight again . gentility and morality made sure of it .  \n",

      "james cagney is best known for his tough characters  and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot  soft  characters in his career . this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star in .  br    br   cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing . and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it . he plays the role with a lot of confidence . he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time  so it actually isn  t a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career . he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in .  br    br   the movie is directed by lloyd bacon  who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre . his earliest     s musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as    nd street  . his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really .     s musicals never were really about its singing  this was something that more featured in     s and later made musicals  mainly from the mgm studios .  br    br   as usual it has a light and simple story  set in the musical world  that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way . it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch . so do the characters and actors that are portraying them . sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie  when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines .  br    br   the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done  even though i  m not a too big fan of the genre itself . once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty . he often played little boys  babies  mice and whatever more early on in his career  including the movie musical  gold diggers of       of one year earlier .  br    br   a recommendable early genre movie .  br    br        \n",

      "an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early      s . audiences must  ve been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle . quite a contrast from his  public enemy   years earlier . cagney does add spark  interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline  plot . but the highlight of the movie is the  elaborate production numbers back to back . first with the conservative  honeymoon hotel  number  then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling  by a waterfall  sequence  followed by the closing  shanghai lil  sequence  cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler . the  shanghai lil  number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown  anti climactic after the more exciting  incredibly mind boggling  by a waterfall  choreography . if i was the director i would  ve inserted the  shanghai lil  number in the middle  close with  by a waterfall   which blows the other  numbers out of the water so to speak  in my view the best of the  numbers . the  production numbers are the frosting on the cake  james cagney  s performance is added decoration to the cake . an outstanding musical achievement  a  star movie  the ultimate musical  well worth watching  you won  t be disappointed           \n",
      "this is a wonderful film . the non  stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate . the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated . i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts . joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together . some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today  s movies . put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is .  \n",

      "when it came out  this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment . to this day it  s more entertaining than most  in great part because it has james cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty  girl friday  played by joan blondell . also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by busby berkeley are pretty much a knock  out as far as that type of thing goes .  br    br   but this is a pretty strange movie . i mean in one of those numbers  you  ve got billy barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler  doing all kinds of weird stuff . ruby keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times  but at least she  s not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films . you  d never guess that dick powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star cagney . as for cagney  his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time . after a while it gets a bit too much . you expect him to walk out and say   hey  i  ve got a great idea for a prologue  the women are cigarettes  and they come out of a pack of smokes  oh no  we did that one last month   it  s funny but it gets a bit repetitive . in the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl  ruth donnelly  some of the established cagney gangster character comes out . in fact frequent b gangster director william keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching  and it seems at times that cagney and blondell are invoking something very  street  even though the characters aren  t criminal .  br    br   the musical numbers . . . what can you say  they stand alone as entertainment  the way that berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling . but none of them really mean anything . it means  honeymoon hotel   nothing really more or less . and the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately  since the characters in the show are doing things that couldn  t possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays . for example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper  things like that . the whole thing could only exist on film  so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous . i can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so  because this is a very polished production .  br    br   it  s great to see cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills  and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like keeler . cagney and blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well . the music i would say is only mediocre  but mostly pleasing if repetitive . bacon  s direction in general is very suitable but never interesting . the film  s entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way . it  s a cut above most  let  s put on a show  films of the   s .  \n",

      "a very early oliver stone  associate   produced film  and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman  co  founder and president of the world  s only real independent film studio troma  creator of the toxic avenger and  at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival  lifetime  achievement awarded filmmaker for over   years  . having raised the money for this film on his own  lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in     and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself . but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore . indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyd  s version of his own script  as one of the world  s most original  daring  experimental and non  compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has . but as it is we have the gershuni  directed film . and weather it is due to the strong script  or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own  sugar cookies is a very intelligent  highly suspenseful and well  crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives . the shoestring budget the small studio  this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over   years now  michael herz  formed troma  had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive  indeed does not have a  low budget  look at all . the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone  played by enigmatic mary woronow  and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i won  t reveal not to spoil a delightful story . this leads to a succession of plot  twists  mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcock  s vertigo and at least as inventive . the atmosphere is a lot grimmer  though  and some comparisons to nicholas roeg  s and donald cammell  s performance come to mind . in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end  which  along with a splendidly interwoven sub  plot with a nod to kaufman  s earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss what  s the fuss  makes for a very exciting one  and  a  half  hour . certainly one of the best films in troma  s library  and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste . the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry  later seen in george romero  s the crazies   thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult  favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself . highly recommended .  \n",

      "passport to pimlico is a real treat for all fans of british cinema . not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy  but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age  with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british life .  br    br   stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton  who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb  discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the   th century duke of burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last    years .  br    br   accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by king edward iv of england  which has never been officially rescinded  to state that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil  which means that in the eyes of international law  pemberton and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it  s own right and a law unto itself .  br    br   this sets the war  battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and jurisdiction  so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books  destroy and ignore their clothing coupons  flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc  declaring themselves fully independent from britain .  br    br   however  what then happens is ever spiv  black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the  border  into burgundy as a refuge from the law and post  war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods  and half of london  s consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration  making their quiet happy little haven  a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that .  br    br   appealing to whitehall for assistance  they are told that due to developments this is  now a matter of foreign policy  which his majesty  s government is reluctant to become involved  which leaves the residents high and dry . they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road  mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of pimlico .  br    br   eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege  with the bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food  but never the less fighting on in true british style . as one bugundian resident quotes   we  re english and we always were english  and it  s just because we are english  we are fighting so hard to be bugundians   br    br   a sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them  by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades .  br    br   will whitehall  who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it  s knees by this new batch of foreigners  especially as these ones are english      br    br   great tale  and great fun throughout . not to be missed .  \n",
      "my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer  today a writer and journalist  has put forward the theory that  just as british film  makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called  thatcher  s britain   the ealing comedies were intended as satires on  attlee  s britain   the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the     general election . this theory was presumably not intended to apply to  say   kind hearts and coronets   which is  if anything  a satire on the edwardian upper classes  or to  the ladykillers  or  the lavender hill mob   both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature . it can  however  be applied to most of the other films in the series  especially  passport to pimlico  .  br    br   pimlico is  or at least was in the forties  a predominantly working  class district of london  set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station . it is not quite correct to say  as has often been said  that the film is about pimlico  declaring itself independent  of britain . what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy . this means that  technically  pimlico is an independent state  and has been for nearly five hundred years  irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants . the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly  but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply .  br    br   because pimlico is not subject to british law  the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please  unhindered by the rationing laws . when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets  the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black  marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the  burgundians   as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves  to surrender .  br    br   many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system  either as an individual as happens in  the man in the white suit  or  the lavender hill mob   or as part of a larger community as happens in  whisky galore  or  the titfield thunderbolt  . the central theme of  passport  is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government  imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties . the film  s particular target is the rationing system . during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism  but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime . it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in      and organisations such as the british housewives  league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing . i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film  s satire were the  spivs   black marketeers   who play a relatively minor part in the action  or the housewives  league  who do not appear at all . the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats  who are portrayed either as having a  rules for rules  sake  mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all .  br    br   i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino .  indeed  i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film  . in      however  four years after the end of the war  the film  makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity  so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain . one of the best  known lines from the film is  we always were english and we always will be english and it  s just because we are english that we  re sticking up for our right to be burgundians  . there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense  tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico  all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics .  br    br   most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave  but in the last scene  after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain . global warming may have altered things slightly  but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief  whatever statistics might say to the contrary  that britain had an abnormally wet climate . the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important .  br    br   there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton  the grocer and small  time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico  and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor . in the main  however  this is  appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together  an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film . it lacks the ill  will and rancour of many more recent satirical films  but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that . it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and  with the possible exception of  kind hearts and coronets  is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies .       \n",
      "every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state . i do not think this is the point of the film at all . the film parodies the spivs  small time criminals who ran the blackmarket  and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation .  br    br   yes of course the film sends up the political  social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society  they want to be british and muddle through rather than foreign .  br    br   but i don  t think they go back to being exactly like they were before .  \n",
      "i commend pictures that try something different . many films just seem like re  treads of old ideas  so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlico .  br    br   the movie is set just after ww  and the post  war shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners  barmy  . the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico . they  too  are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it . that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago  with this document  they reason  they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want  since it turns out they really aren  t british subjects  where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you  ll need to see for yourselves . leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem   \n",

      "it  s true that danny steinmann  s  the unseen  is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot  no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single clich the genre has brought forward over the decades  but that doesn  t necessarily make it a bad film . on the contrary  my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little    s shock  feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting . the beautiful and ambitious reporter jennifer fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival  but their hotel forgot to register their booking . in their search for a place to stay  the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator ernest keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion . one by one the girls experience that keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house .  the unseen  can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics  psycho  and  the texas chainsaw massacre  . the plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films  like twisted family secrets in the cellar  voyeurism  crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens . still  i don  t consider these to be negative remarks  as  the unseen  is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade . although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast  director steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house  unseen  like the title promised . the casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre . sydney lassick  immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient charley cheswick in  one flew over the cuckoo  s nest  is truly the ideal choice for the role of ernest keller . his persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed . also stephen furst  who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen  gives away a tremendous performance as  junior  . he looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving .  the unseen  is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early    s film that will certainly appeal to fans of    s exploitation and generally weird stuff .  \n",

      "i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words  clueless and appalling nonsense .  i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment . one has to suspend one  s disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love  have a child and live together happily ever after . but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one  s heart warmed . is it so impossible  there are far more implausible events described in other movies . the acting is good  the script is funny . the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality .  \n",
      "this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in     . it was a revelation to us . we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children . obviously we were wrong . love may come from where you don  t expect it and maybe don  t want it . but we both chose that love anyway .  br    br   and no  it never changed our sexual orientation . that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos .  br    br   when we were young we both had affairs  but never with the opposite sex . as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs .  br    br   this story is not far fetched . however  the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me . my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last   years . we are still gay . end of story .  \n",
      "this is a film for entertainment i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film . i personally find this film funny  audacious  and memorable . it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess . this film was done very well i might add  in the    s a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person  s sexuality . this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not  it is however about love  in all it  s strange forms . this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the    s in hollywood  or in california . pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men . women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career . bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community .  br    br   then the fantasy begins   let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have  well this movie  which in any way was better than that dismal redo  the next big thing  . perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better .  br    br   i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the    s and it still brings a smile to my lips now . i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny  tender movie  to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun . some people need to lighten up    and this is the film you should do it with   br    br    \n",
      "this movie is as unique as it is overlooked . . . . . . a different story is just that  it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain  one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind . i first saw this on cable in the late    s and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time . i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life . it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family . this film should be available on dvd  vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster  perry king can be acknowledged  but to show how far we have come  still have to go where relationships are concerned .  \n",
      "in order to stop her homosexual friend albert  perry king  from being deported back to belgium  stella  meg foster  decides to marry him . the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian . the two have their separate lives when one night after albert  s birthday party  they fall into bed and then into love . later in the film after falling in love  stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing . what she finds will leave the viewer stunned . this is a great film  very original . perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here . very controversial upon its release in      the  r  rated film is now  pg  in this much more liberal time .  br    br   recently released on dvd  the disc contains a  making of  segment on the special features and in it it  s stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not  real  are mistaken . everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons  these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved   \n",

      "dolph lundgren is back  detention marks dolphs first film in nearly  years  and that is following the delayed hidden agenda . this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips  agent red and stormcatcher . however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda  which was better in almost every respect . what this film does have in it  s favour from dolph  s previous outing  is a sense of cheesy fun . the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role  and it  s good to see dolph doing his own stunts again .  br    br   the films story is ludicrous and prime b  movie material . an ex  military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching  whilst taking a detention class  he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal . the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches . if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy . thankfully the filmmakers don  t take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability  this film has a so bad it  s enjoyable kind of vibe .  br    br   where the film is let down is miss  using a fairly decent budget . the budget of around   million has not been well spent . it  s all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination . the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse . there are some good moments . you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning  with plenty of destruction . the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen .  br    br   as for the cast . hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages . there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film . this however has problems . the actors are on the most part bad . the bad guys are terrible  but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness . the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters . they all hate authority  each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons  but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability . this movie is all about dolph though . while this film is nowhere near his best  it is nowhere near his worst . it also marks a turning point in his career . he is now back in good shape  and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action . dolph looks enthusiastic here  he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man  running from explosions in slow  mo  one liners  and handling large weapons  again in a movie like his older ones  albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one . it is good to see dolph looking energised . his films of the last  or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary  and using doubles a lot  he still does all the fights himself though  but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it .  br    br   overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode . there  s not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm .   \n",
      "this is an absolute great show . jessica alba  besides being the most beautiful women in the world  is a great actress . she does a great job of portraying max  and i could never see anyone else doing that role . she is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous .  \n",
      "this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion  with cool characters  lots of action  and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren  however alex karzis is awful as the villain  . the story is very good  and i found the kids to be likable for the most part  plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this  . the action scenes are excellent  and it  s almost like die hard except it  s set in a school   plus kata dob is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick  . the finale is very exciting  and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well   however i just wished it had another villain  because alex karzis just didn  t cut it as the villain way too ott  and laughable for my tastes . this should be higher then  .  in my opinion  as i thought it was a great action film  and while the kids  were very stupid at times  they got quite resourceful as the movie went along   plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well  . the ending is very amusing  and corey sevier  s character was my favorite student   plus dolph has still got it  . this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion  with cool characters  lots of action  and an amazing performance from lundgren   but alex karzis is awful as the villain  still i highly recommend this one  . the direction is very good  . sidney j . furie does a very good job here with great camera work  good angles  and keeping the film at a very fast pace  . there is a bit of blood and violence . we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds  knife in the side of the head  bloody arrow hits  an impaling  and other minor stuff . the acting is fantastic  . dolph lundgren is amazing as always  and is amazing here  he is extremely likable  kicks that ass as usual  had great chemistry with the kids  had an awesome character  is very charismatic  and he may not have shown a great emotional rage  he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch   he is one of my favorite actors   lundgren rules       . alex karzis is god awful as the villain  he is laughably ott  was boring  and not menacing at all  he also annoyed the crap out of me . kata dob is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do  she was the real villain in my opinion  . corey sevier is funny as mick  he was my favorite student  and i really started to warm up to him in the  nd half  i liked him a lot   he had good chemistry with dolph too . dov tiefenbach  willy   chris collins  hogie   mpho koaho  jay tee   danielle hampton  alicia   nicole dicker  charlee  all do great as the students . jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fiance . rest of the cast do fine . overall i highly recommend this one  .     out of   \n",
      "this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick  it isn  t going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie . our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day . sure the script isn  t going to win any oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action . dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes  and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well . all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick  but youv  e seen it a million times before .  \n",
      "i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw . it was a cool fun movie . dolph looked superbly cool on the bike . he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies . he is now in a pretty good shape . the story was ok and the other actors were also passable . i wouldn  t call this movie his best but its still a good movie .  br    br   but it also had its share of problems . the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target . they should  ve had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way . another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing . i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom . the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers . there should  ve been more bad guys . last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy  but that was due to the small budget . overall the movie was a good movie . i enjoyed it . i would recommend others to watch it . p . s . now u r a dead beat cop .  some one  liners were also cool   br    br    \n",
      "there has been a political documentary  of recent vintage  called why we fight  which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation . it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq . yet  a far more famous series of films  with the same name  was made during world war two  by hollywood director frank capra . although considered documentaries  and having won oscars in that category  this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop  more in the vein of leni reifenstal  s triumph of the will  scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes . that said  that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries  such as the bbc  s lauded the world at war  lacked  nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable . they are skillfully made  and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store  i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase . i chose goodtimes dvd  s four dvd collection of the series .  br    br   rarely has something free been so worth invaluable . while there are no extras on the dvds  and the sound quality of the prints varies  these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago  when racism was overt  as in many of the classic warner brothers pro  war cartoons of the era   and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts . the seven films  produced between     and      are prelude to war  the nazis strike  divide and conquer  the battle of britain  the battle of russia  the battle of china  and war comes to america .  br    br   overall  the film series is well worth watching  not only for the obvious reasons  but for the subtle things it reveals  such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars  rather than the modern singular  or the most overused graphic in the whole series  a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria . yet  it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars . the lesson of world war one  avoid foreign entanglements  was not applicable to world war two  whose own lesson  act early against dictatorships  has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since korea  vietnam  nor iraq . the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today  s information  clogged times . it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today  but at least you  ll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position  nor will you be the last .  \n",
      "the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler  s grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe .  br    br   clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the  allied bias  turning out to be historical fact . the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east . the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds .  br    br   the disparity between hitler  s military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag  declaring  peace in our time  to this day has durable propaganda qualities . here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options  freedom or slavery . in     there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively .  \n",
      "adolf hitler  s maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u . s . war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii . hitler  s plan was methodical and well conceived  starting with the conquest of eastern europe  expanding to the european heartland  then moving on to the  world island  consisting of europe  asia and africa . his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world .  br    br   in      hitler ordered national conscription  as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell . grade school children sang his praises  and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps . marching unopposed into austria in      hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland . in      hitler took all of czechoslovakia . later in the year  the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non  aggression pact with it  s mortal enemy russia  a ploy to delay hitler  s military involvement on too many fronts . immediately after  germany invaded poland  bringing hitler  s conquest right to russia  s doorstep . he would deal with her later .  br    br   it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler  s thrust across europe . prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany  his infamous declaration stating  peace in our time  . it didn  t turn out that way .  br    br   the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment  at least to me  was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid     s . it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland . the venue  madison square garden   \n",
      "this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war . the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler  s rise .  br    br   every school child  nay  every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos . history has been repeating itself over and over again  the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups  are still working to these evil group  s advantage .  br    br   by sitting back and letting hitler as early as     be aggressive  france  america and england caused over   million people  s deaths . americans  french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties .  br    br   these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs . they don  t tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them  fighting hitler . this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war .  \n",
      "i can  t understand what it is that fans of the genre didn  t like about this film . it was truly a lot of fun . the special effects were wonderful . i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters  but not this time . i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn  t enjoy the film . i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen  but again this was not the case . to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time . blair witch and the mummy . both films that i thought were terrible . blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time . the mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck . people liked it for it  s special effects . films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development  they are more like funhouse rides . well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting  s e  ticket .  \n",
      "what can i say that hasn  t been said about  the haunting   it has everything that would make a great picture . wonderful sets  moody music  and sound design to die for were all in place . the screenplay  though  sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird  surrealistic way . the entire team must have forgotten to read it through  maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was . each member of the cast gives a worthy performance  although with little conviction to the material at hand . lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her . but that  s about it . all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours  but you will definitely want more . a lot more .  \n",

      "some films just simply should not be remade . this is one of them . in and of itself it is not a bad film . but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the     film of the same title . liam neeson was excellent as he always is  and most of the cast holds up  with the exception of owen wilson  who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke . but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it  s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects . again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film . but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .  \n",

      "i know it is fashionable now to hate this movie . i have seen hundreds of spook films including he original     haunting as well as most of the hammer films . this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it . yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts . actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great . i have seen it   times now and it gets better every time . the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the  th sense . the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring . perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure . the old haunting was also a fine film from     . it was even more scary . see both and also the innocents and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin .  \n",
      "the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house  good effects work and sound work  a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house . there are scenes that make you jump  and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past  i found interesting . there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets  curtains and the house itself . jerry goldsmith  s score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you . what i wish could  ve happened is for something a little more intense . jan de bont had a pg    rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much . poltergeist scared me silly when i saw it many years ago  and it still holds up . the haunting could  ve used a few more scenes of pure terror . the ending was for me  a little anticlimactic . overall  i enjoyed it . the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump . i just wish it scared me more .  \n",

      "jeopardy is a tense  satisying thriller  a cut above a b but not really a major production . it qualifies as almost an experimental film  as the studio that produced it  metro  was desperately looking for new kinds of films  stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television . the director  john sturges  was an up  and  comer whose best years lay ahead . he had just recently begun directing a level films  and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman . stars barbara stanwyck  barry sullivan and ralph meeker  were at very different phases of their careers . stanwyck  s glory years were behind her  and yet she could still carry a film  as she proves here . barry sullivan  as her husband  was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him . he was a fine  low  key actor  poised  but in an upper middle rather than upper class way  which made him excellent in professional roles . as the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save sullivan  s life  he is trapped under a pier  and the tide is rising   ralph meeker is more energetic than usual . this excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after brando and clift . he was in his way as good an actor as either of them  but he lacked charisma . his bargaining with stanwyck  which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband  by implication only  as this is       makes for an intriguing premise which  had this been a different kind of film  could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about stanwyck  s character . meeker is indeed a more exciting character than sullivan and in her scenes with him stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son . but as this is a formula picture  not a strindberg play  the possibility that stanwyck might want want to have a fling    leaving aside the question of her husband  s predicament    remains unexplored . in this sense the incoming tide doesn  t quite have the effect one might have wished  though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting  fine location photography  nearly all of it outdoors  and excellent direction by the woefully underrated mr . sturges .  \n",

      "as many reviewers here have noted  the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story . i have never seen the stage version of the story  and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers . perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film  but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas  show . the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try  out group . this way our attention is focused on the dancers  movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try  outs . douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part . apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one  and the backstage clich  ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added . i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film . the repeated intrusions cassie made during try  outs appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and  or luck . however  this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past  and it  s curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again . the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the  i can do that  number  but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories . frankly  their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this .  of  stars .  \n",

      "like a lot of series pilots  dark angel  s opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet . not that this is unusual in any way  but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more . in today  s world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation  the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused  with all guns blazing .  br    br   the ninety  minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together  and both episodes have a problem with focus . in the first half  we are introduced to max and filled in on what drives her . we also get a few interesting routines with max using her abilities to win bets  interacting with a pi  or sorting out co  workers  domestic problems . the problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes  on television or otherwise .  br    br   it  s when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus . throughout the two halves  max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time . in the second half  the repercussions catch up with him  and max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess . this sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series  and it works  but it doesn  t quite click if you get my meaning . it  s like most of the pieces are there  but a couple that make a complete image have been left out . perhaps they get filled in with later episodes  but that  s beside the point . the fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty  eight less minutes .  br    br   the last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing . original cindy in particular is an annoyance  and i doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes . while the acting isn  t as bad as daytime soap  it isn  t of such quality that i  d commend it . jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world  but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least .  br    br   the good news is that the premise and the production values are all top  notch . in fact  this series was considered quite expensive to produce  and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didn  t last a whole season . especially when there was ample time for both shows  they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality tv . the fact is that we need more shows like dark angel  where imagination rather than overhype  are used to draw the attention .  br    br   in all  i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten . it never rises above the level of throwaway television  and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time . but the potential is there  and that  s often all that matters where pilots are concerned .  \n",

      "this is a better than average silent movie and it  s still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents . however  if you aren  t yet a fan of the genre  i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one . that  s because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots . but  despite this  it  s still a good film and kept my interest .  br    br   a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him . the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief . despite this  she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life . however  the rent is due and there  s no money  so the lady is forced to look for work . she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal . unfortunately  the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can  t make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man  s date . well  like cinderella  she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her  what to do now   given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her   well  see the movie yourself to see how it  s all resolved . i didn  t like how they handled the husband  as it seemed awfully predictable and clichd . however  once he was out of the way  i do admire how the film also didn  t give up a by  the  numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends .  br    br   all in all  a very good film worth seeing  but certainly not great .  \n",

      "this film is definitely an odd love story . though this film may not be much to shout about  nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten  though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans  hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area . what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series  heartbeat  soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick . nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends  up as fairly decent weekend entertainment . a good one to watch  and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character .  \n",
      "are you a giraffe  . . . ask john to nadia  and she  sure of responding well  responds him yes . in this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don  t know each other  and at the same time  the questions and doubts in  birthday girl  . a film that i heard a lot of times  but i don  t dare to see . . . until two hours of write this .  br    br    birthday girl  is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count  at the same time  that nicole kidman is one of the best actress  besides she is pretty and intelligent  that i have ever seen .  birthday girl  is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet . the woman that he finds comes from russia . she seems to be that delicate woman  normal  not more . one day  in her birthday comes suddenly  his cousin and his friend . the man  begin to discover certain things . since here  he don  t going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been .  br    br   much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot . much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don  t novel . but  birthday girl  is just the opposite . this movie is full of good surprises  good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined . this romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind .  birthday girl  have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes  but at the same time  certain touching nature  and makes it so deeper .  br    br    birthday girl  is sometimes sad  sometimes funny  sometimes violent  but at the end  is totally satisfactory . and i  m not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece .  br    br   sorry for the mistakes . . . well  if there any .  \n",

      "this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching . the story is engaging and it doesn  t take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention . the acting is first class and the characters are represented well . sometimes it feels like the director couldn  t decide himself between drama and romantic comedy . ben chiller  s portrayal of the law abiding and shy englishman with porn s . m . magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs  as does the look in nicole kidman  s eyes when she is offering john his first taste of intimacy in a long time . . . other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant .  \n",

      "i would like to comment the series as a great effort . the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well  especially in season  . season  however became more of a freak show  and lost da  s original charm . season one story line was more interesting  a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x  series . i was looking forward to new seasons  in fact i still am . i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback . even after  yrs of it being cancelled  da can make it big if worked on properly  and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge .  \n",

      "spoilers     is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc .  french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it . before     nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario . on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change . as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane  this is the only footage of the first impact . he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building . as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident . in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible  in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds  these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground  this is the most grueling moment in the documentary . then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life  you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building . then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black  he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york . because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody  s memory . i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of  so this makes it even more realistic to watch .       \n",

      "it took us a couple of episodes to  get into  dark angel as a story and a series  since we were transitioning from the sopranos  a very different mentality framework . but  once we got with the gist of the series  we were very quickly hooked . it  s a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category dark angelwas much more than your average tv series . it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes  but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to  mutants  reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face  and make  everyday . that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti  discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces  hence not ruining the  fun  for those who don  t like to be lectured during entertainment   but every event and human  societal interaction remains relevant to the present . we all make judgments  face our own prejudices  but  in the end  the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it  or do you get up and do something about it  for those who have no choice but to fight  for survival or justice  this series empowers them . for those who  ve never had to face the question  this series  sneaks in  that message under the guise of pure action entertainment . it is much more well  made and well  written than most tv series i  m highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear .  \n",

      "the events of september       do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers . in my view it would have been better to leave this out . i think the directors tried too hard  perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop . the comment of one of a policemen   this aint fing disneyworld  is apt .  br    br   nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events . the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times  no other footage from the day matches what they shot .  \n",

      "incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september   th . intense  personal  and completely riveting      is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident  which kind of gives it an even greater appeal . up until that morning  filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team  concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman . out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup  jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center  and from there a simple documentary was no more .  br    br   viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero  as the amazing group of fire  fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster . without hesitation  naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it  s entire support crumbles around them . the raw fear of an unknown  impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside . nearly as memorable is older brother gideon  s candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed . by the time we get to see the second tower collapse  as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris  we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up  close footage captured .  br    br   obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event  though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document  only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage  even if it cost them their own safety .  br    br   after viewing      and seeing that it came out in      i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone  s recent rendition  the big budgeted world trade center . many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble  and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought      all but renders his film completely obsolete . not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day  but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again .  \n",
      "to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible . every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid  fire images  through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero  but every frame is real . the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york . jules     and gideon     naudet  pronounced  nau  day   want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters  beginning with a  newbie  from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full  fledged firefighter . seeking the help of their close friend  actor james hanlon      an actor and firefighter at station   engine   the naudets sift through the  probies  at the academy and find one  tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on .  br    br   tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close  knit family . firefighters have a superstition about  probies .  it is that they are either  white clouds  or  black clouds   meaning that with the latter  all kinds of fires follow the  probie .  the former means that very little fire activity follows  but one day  there will be the mother of all fires . tony is a  white cloud .  after some initial growing pains  tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet . then the unthinkable occurs . . . .  br    br   september        begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street . because jules has had little camera experience  gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief  t . k . pfeiffer . arriving at about      the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate . then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene  and as jules pans upwards  we see the first strike of the day . american airlines flight   smashes into the face of the north tower of  world trade . pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center . once there  jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower . pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him . once inside  the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives .  br    br   gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area . once there  he captures the impact of the second plane  united airlines flight     with  world trade . he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers . watching and capturing the crowds  reaction to the unimaginable  gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan . inside tower one  jules records the last view the world  or loved ones will have of their sons  fathers  uncles  grandfathers  husbands  boyfriends  friends as one by one  each firefighter  carrying   lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up   stories to rescue the injured and trapped . jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother  kevin  as he leaves to do his selfless duty . also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones  sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke . but jules is respectful  never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment . . . the money shot . his work is professional through his baptism of fire . he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building . then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken father michael judd  the chaplain for the fire department . then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two  tower one begins its structural collapse .  br    br   what results is a breathtakingly  poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day . not knowing if either is alive  each fearing the worst . as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse  they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back . and in one moment of overwhelming emotion  jules and gideon are reunited . as jules cries on his brother  s shoulder  gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject . there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos  who left the station with a former chief  is believed to have been lost . . . but returns to the fold  this  probie  has proven himself .  br    br   shown with only three interruptions      is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking . it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds . the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject . in lesser hands  the tendency would be toward the sensational  but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion . narrated by hanlon  we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september   . robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre  restrained way . he never seeks the camera for his own glory  rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see . i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special . chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings  they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished . this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is . it isn  t about dribbling a basketball  or selling an album of hate lyrics . . .     is about humanity at its best . heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom .  br    br    \n",

      "i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs . i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day  i was going to school at hunter college . i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again  but like many i was curious to see what this was all about . tears came to my eyes watching this documentary . all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable . i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times . how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible . if you have not seen this documentary  do yourself a favor and check it out . it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes  but it  s an incredible document of this countries darkest hour .  \n",
      "great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time . . that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item . . what shocked me was not only the attacks  but the  high fat diet  and physical appearance of some of these firefighters . i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that  in the physical shape they were in  some of these firefighters would not of made it to the   th floor carrying over   lbs of gear . having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job . the french have a history of making great documentary  s and that is what this is  a great documentary . . . . .  \n",

      "warning  mild spoilers ahead    br    br    yes  i realize it  s tough to spoil an historical documentary  but i do reveal some of the backstory and methods .   br    br   this is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage  but also due to the story behind it . because the naudets did not set out to tell the story of      but rather that of a rookie firefighter  the men  s emotions and the viewer  s connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective .  br    br   in a filmmaking sense        is textbook . if the events were an actual script  they would be superb  as the characters are established  then thrown a curve to which they must react . this is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together .  br    br   the first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station specifically  how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans . that part alone is quite good  and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course  it probably would have been solid . the brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a nyc firefighter .  br    br   then of course  all hell breaks loose . the chaos following the wtc attacks is vividly seen  as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations . seeing not only the attacks  but also the first  hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion .  br    br   the aftermath  in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found  is human drama at its peak . life and death hang in the balance . unlike many movies  the viewer not only doesn  t know who will live and die  but genuinely cares about them .  br    br   the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the robert deniro  whom i like  blurbs were uninformative  unnecessary  and didn  t advance the story at all . they were probably added just to attract more television viewers .  br    br   bottom line the best documentary i  ve ever seen . nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama .  .  out of   .  \n",
      "     is a classic example of cinema verite  a sort of realist documentary  in this case of new york firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history . it  s all tiny  unobtrusive  hand  held video cameras  often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming  and by the director  naudet  s hand frequently wiping the screen  .  br    br   in this film  you get to know most of the firemen  tony benatatos  the rookie  or  probie   in ny fireman vernacular   the fire chief joseph pfeiffer  who finds he  s lost his brother later on  and a few others . there are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film  just to emphasise the personal  reflexive nature of the events . the build  up is quite dramatic and well  done  particularly the passing  out ceremony at the fire department  with a few useful swish  pans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork  just like rob reiner  s a few good men  . tony looks proud .  br    br   the viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen  which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of wtc  while pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next  this is classic cinema verite . there is also the eery  haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside . it is then that an increasingly forlorn fire chief pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless  and this is before wtc  collapses . you have to give credit to naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which moment .  br    br   the sound of the neighbouring wtc  collapsing is so awfully sad  poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen . from the lobby  it looks  feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened . you hear an enormous rumbling  trembling maelstrom  like that of a giant  monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded  the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in wtc  are oblivious to this event . where is the communication   br    br   this film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided  cues like  this really was a day like no other  or naudet  s frequently banal pronouncements like  you could see fear in everybody  s eyes  and  i knew tony was freaking out   the film is really just one long video diary . there are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone . imagine this film blended with cctv footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day . the effect would be greater . you could even combine this story with that of mayor giuliani and  perhaps  the famous cornishman rick riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the hero .  br    br   i don  t see much of a propaganda element in this film  as some reviewers suggest . this film is no triumph of the will  by riefenstahl . some time later the firemen drape the american flag over a nearby  surviving building overlooking what has become ground zero . so what   br    br   there are also some moments of dubious camerawork for example  who is holding the camera when the two naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station  is it staged   br    br   there is an excellent finish  very much in the traditon of the excellent french director alain resnais  hiroshima mon amour   with two strips of light reflected in the water  shimmying .  \n",

      "i was one of many that expected to see a glorified  yankee  doodle dandy portrayal of a day that  as famously quoted  should live in infamy  rather than glory . how wrong i was . these guys were there  right in the middle of it  and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking . and yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on september        .  br    br   two french filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a ny firefighter  particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks . at the beginning we see much of this footage  just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism . this was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others  and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge .  br    br   while investigating a suspect gas line  i think  my memory  s a little hazy on that   we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead . the camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers . what must the cameraman have been thinking at this time  recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on  and possibly realizing the same thing  the fdny allow the camera to follow them into the building .  br    br   what follows is a true view from the front  lines . we see the commitment of the fdny  their reactions  the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling  as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside  while a second camera captures the events from the outside .  br    br   if it wasn  t for the horrific event they were covering  the footage alone would be any young doco  maker  s dream come true . quite simply  the footage deserves to be preserved for all time . but what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer . we see firefighters charging in without hesitation  people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another  they are brothers  as they cannot reach one another in the confusion . there are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film  something hollywood could never duplicate  even though it  s trying  .  br    br       isn  t a film about politics . nor is it a film about religion  nationality or even jihad for that matter .     is a film about people  and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of .     is quite simply one of the most important films i  ve ever seen  and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me . you can  t duplicate this .  \n",

      "radiofreccia is a movie about all of us  about our dreams  our friends  our obsessions  our addictions  our fears . it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century . the movie doesn  t take a happy or sad approach on things  it just tells us a story  one that all of us could have experienced . one of happiness and excitement  sadness and grief . the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters  it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again  feeling closer to the little town in emilia romagna where it takes place . hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to freccia and his friends  listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing radio raptus international  playing their dreams  our dreams . radiofreccia will make you laugh  it will make you cry at times  it will shock you and comfort you  it will give you and take from you . personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life  and that of my friends  and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours .  \n",
      "now this show looks like most of the other shows of it  s type from the mid     s  but the only thing is about this one is that it  s different  they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too . i personally thought it was a good show  i can  t understand why would they cancel it . the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since     up to date .  br    br   my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie  which i know is gonna be impossible to do  but hey it doesn  t hurt to dream  doesn  t it   br    br   anyway  i would recommend if you hadn  t seen it to find the dvd of all   episodes  because the characters are great  the story lines are good  the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great .  \n",
      "a classic cartoon  always enjoyable and funny . it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters . road rovers is a show worth seeing  it is a short   episodes  and if you can ever manage a chance to see it  you should . unfortunately  it is very hard to find . i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all   episodes . i would definitely buy it if they did  and if they do  you should buy it too . if you have kids who like dogs  they will love road rovers  road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired  it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was .  \n",
      "this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes  the money pit and are we done yet   only points out all the more how the    s movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since  regretfully  been lost .  br    br   i was   when i first saw this and even at that tender age  there was much i could laugh at . now of course being familiar with adult frustrations  i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth .  br    br   the three main actors . . . cary grant  myrna loy  and melvyn douglas . . . interacted perfectly  but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream . it  s never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions .  br    br   all in all  this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it .  \n",
      "far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did  after animaniacs . even if the ratings were low  so what  i still enjoyed it and loved it  was so funny and i adored the cast  wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic  the whole cast were brilliant  especially the legendary frank welker .  br    br   i  d love to see this cartoon again  was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant . also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it  you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental  that was just fantastic  i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in . i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back  i loved them  \n",
      "the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world . the show was hilarious to say the least . simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages . running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game . the action was mesmerizing  and cleverly set up . the characters were very original  each with a very different personality . but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters . each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed  but implied in subtext . hopefully  one day  there  ll be some way to watch the rovers in action again .  \n",
      "michael stearns plays mike  a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality . he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that  s when he loses it . he believes that when women actually have sex that  s when they lose any sense of  innocence  and  or  beauty  . so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance  ultimately shooting the men dead with a high  powered rifle with a scope .  br    br   the seeming primary reason for this movie  s existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again . the  story  comes off as more of an afterthought . this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we  re treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity  the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes  and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation . of course  seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism .  for one thing  mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger .  this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack .  br    br   those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another . it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain how to react . it unfolds at a very slow pace  but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist . it  s a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen .  br    br        \n",

      "russell  my fav  is gorgeous in this film . but more than that  the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow . everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected . the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity . fabulous love story between lachlin and lil . i replay their scenes over and over again . anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people . all characters are cast and portrayed excellently .  \n",
      "movie  comedies  nowadays are generally    minutes of toilet humor  foul language  and groin  kicking . modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator  the undemanding and slow of brain . sure  an occasional good comedy will come along  but they  re becoming rarer all the time .  br    br    mr . blandings buildings his dream house  shows what     s hollywood was capable of  and it  s just screamingly funny . jim and muriel blandings  cary grant and myrna loy  decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs . the film follows their story  beginning with house hunting trips  the house  s riotous construction  all the way to the finished home   with its  zuzz  zuzz water softener  .  br    br   grant and loy are perfect for their roles  of course  grant is particularly funny as he watches the house  s costs zoom out of control  . however  the film is stolen by the blandings  wise attorney  played to perfection by melvyn douglas . managing to steal every scene he  s in  douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis . reginald denny as the blandings  harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful .  br    br   i  ve watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh . i think it  s a good film to watch when you need a lift  whether you  re building a house or not .  \n",
      "very nicely done movie . it does stay in your memory . better billed as a romance than flying or war  altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free . flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes  unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love .  br    br   fun watching early crowe . he is good and exudes charm . his reading of  high flight  is superb .  br    br   cheers  boom  \n",
      "this film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life . we get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight . a very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don  t just happen on the front .  br    br   luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great  grandparents  grandparents or parents went through during a war . this film  i think  is a small thank you . peter outerbridge looks amazingly like a young peter o  toole and russell crowe is absolutely charming and as australian as he can be . it  s definitely worth listening to him recite  high flight  and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with shakespeare .  \n",
      "japanese tomo akiyama  s keko mask       is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch  there are also some sequels  but i haven  t seen them since these films are hyper rare . some kind of re  releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films . the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline  which is  according to the teachers  the most important thing in education . the school is lead by incredibly funny looking  just look at the costume   human wizard  whatever  who is like principal in the school  and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed . well  the main thing about the film is its name  keko mask  who is some beautiful and masked fairy  who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers  yes  this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background . the most important thing is  of course  that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked  her identity is never revealed in these films  and also the credits say  keko mask unknown  while the actor names are listed   br    br   the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies . she has a gorgeous  but lethal vagina  yes  you read right . she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them  spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view  after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs  the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like  i  ve never seen such a beautiful vagina  and  now i can die in peace .  this film is totally fantastic    br    br   there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films  japanese censors optically fog  blur all the pubic hair in any film  and also about some restrictions among school students  like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc .  there  s one great scene in which one nerd sees girl  s bare you  know  what for the first time  and says  hey there  s no fog in it   i couldn  t help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this . also  one character says in the end that he will return  if japan films allows to make the sequel . i  m glad it allowed as i  ve heard the sequels are equally outrageous . one sequel should include blues brothers  yes  those blues brothers   in it etc .  br    br   this is trash in its most enjoyable  funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find . this would definitely be even greater experience  if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point  but fortunately those segments are very few . this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don  t mention here and it wouldn  t be even necessary to tell them all here . if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek  i think you  ll love this little gem as i do  and the director is definitely a genius in this field      perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal   \n",
      "i turned this on to see the incredible ethel waters  whose autobiography i am now reading . i  ll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in  but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece . it  s pretty much a short film made by blacks  for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time  old trends exaggerated for humor . we see modern black movies do the same thing  but with the new trends  stereotypes    ho  s  and the  hood  and such . i think if you look back in eighty years  you would find today  s movies will look just as racist . what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the pint  sized sammy davis jr .  who out taps his contemporary  shirley temple  and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult . everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it . why not enjoy it for what it is  instead of what you think it should have been   \n",
      "given the opposite circumstance of     where the reality is we do have a black president  this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance . for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant . i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time  but also found the music and dancing incredible . also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor . he plays rufus jones  a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy . he is told  why some day you could be president  . this was so ridiculous in     that it was mocked and thought to be endearing  charming and funny . the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man . they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church .  br    br   the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in . it is really well done and very entertaining . i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us . in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president  but that it is normal  just makes this movie that much more relevant . it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness .  \n",

      "i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating  because i wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds . as a matter of fact  they didn  t  at least  so its seems . some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie  that  s it  this is what the majority of viewers think . however  the surprise comes at the end  and unfortunately then  when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie . i was also astonished when i saw that the brazilian  portuguese title of this movie means  voyage into death  . this is the spoiler .  br    br   that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat  on reasons that are completely unclear   you understand only in the last  minutes . when you start the movie with the english title  haunted boat  in your head  you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the  ghosts  . but in reality  this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer  watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality  it is told from the perspective of the young girl . we see her not alone  but together with the four friends because she sees them . we do not see that she is alone . so  the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture  stream  but the main story  we have at least two parallel worlds the world in which the girl is and the world in which the  friends are . an intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat .  br    br   i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie  the movie  makers  cheated  an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film  student elaborate with hastily  chosen  pseudo  actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers . how mistaken can one be  but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes  the end that follows gives another surprise . the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat . when she has recovered from her shock  she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends . and there they are again  they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore . she jumps into the water  arrives at the boat  and they are away . miraculously beautiful . it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a rhetoromance writer when i awoke  i saw death standing at my bed . but i closed my eyes . when i opened them again  he was gone .  \n",
      "i also saw this upon its release in     and have been struck since then with its final scene . if this is an answer to  high noon   then it  s an apt and apposite response . the notion that  as this string is headed   the town comes together  is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of  high noon .  in this theme   concho  is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all  time favorites   the magnificent seven .  both sinatra and conrad give impressive and convincing performances  especially sinatra  s transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior . i can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years i  ve inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves .  \n",
      "i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england . i  ve seen hundreds of films since  but i  ve never forgotten this one . although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character  he was excellent in the role . a lot of people seem to think that he did  nt really come into his own until his role in  from here to eternity  but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho . the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad . i  d never see or heard of him before this film . conrad plays a terrific part in this film . i remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character . also i remember the music  that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears . an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again . it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth . i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color  i remember sinatra  s blue shirt .  \n",

      "still crazy has been compared to the spinal tap since both are comedies about wash  up rr groups . actually  here the similarity ends because still crazy is much better written and acted out  whereas spinal tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first   min into a drivel that makes beavis and butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison . still crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie . people who expect spinal tap  like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light  hearted nature of the movie  but i  d take a successful self  ironic romp of still crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is spinal tap .  \n",

      "in the voice over which begins the film  hughie  billy connolly   a roadie for the great    s band strange fruit  said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop strange fruit  s set was that god was sick of    s excess . indeed  it  s been popular to put down that era of music  and see punk as a welcome antidote to it . while i agree the excess was tiresome  as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it   and like punk  i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock  and this film about strange fruit  s long  strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days .  br    br   one of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes . brian gibson directed what  s love got to do with it  about tina turner  while i had problems with the dramatic parts of the film  the music was handled very well   writers dick clement and ian le frenais co  wrote the commitments and were behind the music  oriented british tv show over the rainbow  and the songs strange fruit played were co  written by foreigner  s mick jones  not to be confused with the clash  s mick jones   so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about . also  two cast members are musicians in their own right  bill nye i don  t know about  though the film credits him with his own singing  and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era  while jimmy nail was in another british tv show which was music  oriented  though i forget the name  and he was in evita   and the others are convincing at it . and while  as i said  a lot of    s bands like strange fruit behaved badly towards women  the movie doesn  t make the same mistake  except for the woman who follows timothy spall around   as the manager of the reunion  juliet aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character .  br    br   the other actors are all good as well  with special praise to stephen rea  who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality . there are a couple of plot points which don  t work  but overall this is quite enjoyable . oh yeah  and the music is good too .  \n",

      "there can be no denying that hak se wui  election in english  is a well made and well thought out film . the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition  a theme played with throughout the film where john woo  s hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled       and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the  bad  point of view  they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable  a good example being city on fire       .  br    br   election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes  spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful  if that  s the right word  manner as well as the clever little  in pieces  of film  making . it  s difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in  not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say  goes . the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run . needless to say certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds  some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular .  br    br   election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third . trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points . i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested . this happens a few times a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested there  s a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested some other triads are having a pre  election talk but the police show up and guess what  you know .  br    br   once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would  it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving . the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it  s been hotwired  another chase involving a motorbike and a kung  fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street  the scenes are unpredictable  realistic and violent but like i said  they are in a  tasteful  manner . where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail . when the triads are in jail  the bars are covered with wire suggesting they  re all animals in cages as that  s how they behave on the outside when in conflict . another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol  elevating themselves above other head gangsters who  d use champagne  the long good friday  and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate .  br    br   election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise  en  scene as you look at what  s going on . some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies . the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film hinting at chinese tradition in the process . i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic  unpredictable and violent in a tasteful manner  of course .  \n",
      "election is a chinese mob movie  or triads in this case . every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader  and at first it seems a toss up between big d  tony leung ka fai  or as i know him   the other tony leung   and lok  simon yam  who was judge in full contact   . though once lok wins  big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader . unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters  this one is not an action movie . it has its bloody moments  when necessary  as in goodfellas  but it  s basically just a really effective drama . there are a lot of characters  which is really hard to keep track of  but i think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit . a     year  old baton  which is the symbol of power i mentioned before  changes hands several times before things settle down . and though it may appear that the film ends at the   or    minute mark  there are still a couple big surprises waiting . simon yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture .  br    br   election was quite the award winner at last year  s hong kong film awards  winning for best actor  tony leung   best picture  best director  johnny to  who did heroic trio     and best screenplay . it also had nominations for cinematography  editing  film score  which i loved   and three more acting performances  including yam  .  \n",
      "first off  i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence . i say unfortunately  because after seeing election  first  election seems a bit of a disappointment . both films are gangster epics that are similar in form . and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema . . . it  s just not nearly as good as it  s sequel .  br    br   in the first election installment  we are shown the two competitors for chairman big d and lok . after a few scenes of discussion amongst the  uncle  s  as to who should have the chairman title  they  almost unanimously  decide that lok  simon yam  will helm the triads . suffice to say this doesn  t go over very well with competitor big d  tony leung ka fai  and in a bid to influence the takeover  big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side . this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war . lok is determined to become chairman but won  t become official until he can recover the  dragon head baton   a material representation of the chairman  s power . the current chairman  whistle  chung wang  has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first .  br    br   much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton . as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides  which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election  which involves an underling named jet  nick cheung   a machete  and lots of bad guys . nick cheung  s presence is attention grabbing to say the least . . . i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election  as he does deliver more of jet  s character in the sequel .  br    br   while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance  i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film  s actors . election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting . simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo  tony leung ka fai  and the under  appreciated suet lam . there really aren  t any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they  re watching real gangsters .  br    br   although the performances are great  one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to  s eye for the camera . there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots  as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles . all of which makes election  above all  a great looking film .  br    br   my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election . it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren  t integral to the plot . while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates  the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles  underlings  and police officers crowding the storyline . maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad  or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more .  br    br   bottom line  all in all  this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast  excellent direction  and leisurely pacing that packs a punch . it  s just a little more complicated than it needed to be .  \n",
      "it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films  but i think it  s the best way to give an approximation of the place election occupies in the gangster genre arena . it works somewhere in between the godfather and kinji fukasaku  s yakuza opus the yakuza papers  aka battles without honour and humanity   in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic  dark and gritty . but it  s also a johnnie to film  and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur .  br    br   every two years the hk triad elects a new boss . only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the triads and the police . that  s the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that . as in the yakuza papers  there  s a great deal of scheming  back  stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances  sometimes all it takes is a phone call  in one of the most memorable scenes i  ve seen in recent time  which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict . fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect . election is not as action  oriented as one might expect although it is violent . and i  m not talking about the glossy  glamour version of hollywood violence . this is dark and grim . to  s camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not .  br    br   if you  re familiar with to  s style  then you should know what to expect . the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate . the cinematography is great  slick and dark in equal measures  utilizing dark hues  brown  dark green and orange  while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it . in the end  election occupies a peculiar place . it  s not exactly a character study and it  s not an action  oriented gangster film . it explores a situation  the election and its aftermath   but does so in style  and is both realistic and romanticized  the triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental godfather  .  \n",

      "for a slasher flick  this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre . yes it is predictable  resident nut job goes on killing spree  people die  yada yada yada . however there are some good positives in this film . first off  i really liked the mask the nut job wore . it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique  although i haven  t watched every single slasher film ever made  also  the genesis of the bad due is something i haven  t seen before  and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept  as far as i know . i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by mr sicko  for most of the murders . the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre  but that  a small concern . the movie does not take itself seriously  which is something most slashers suffer from . oddly enough  while watching the movie  i was reminded of the early  friday the   th films  which did take themselves seriously . there are a few concerns about this movie . in several scenes  the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons . by this  i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot  and also the way he walked . of bigger concern  however is a scene very close to the end  where mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance  actually a complete rip off  of another famous horror titan . and in the very last scenes  we have our scumbag  once again  looking exactly like the  st horror icon i mentioned . in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip  off from another icon in the slasher genre . these scenes were weak and unoriginal  obviously  . by the way  the movie is set in australia  so if you  re a sucker for a chick with an aussie accent  like me  you  ll be in heaven . if you not  than it just might grate on you . one other great thing about this moviebeautiful kylie minogoue  just don  t get too attached to her  there is one non aussie accent  courtesy of molly ringwald . overall  there are more reasons to watch than not . i enjoyed it and had some fun . so  i have to give  cut       which may seem too high to some people .  \n",
      "twelve years ago  production stopped on the slasher flick  hot blooded  since almost everyone on the set started dying . now  a couple of film students have decided to finish the film  despite the fact that there  s a rumor that the film is cursed . well  they  re about to find out that some curses are real .  br    br   when scream was released  every country seemed to want to cash in on its success  even australia . the concept  which today has been done to death  a slasher film within a slasher film  was at the time relatively cool and original . this movie was released right before urban legends final cut and scream   well not in the us but in australia  so it felt like the first movie with this concept . when urban legends  was released  most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn  t even good  the movie flopped disastrously . now  cut is not the best slasher flick ever  and nor does it try to be . it knows that it  s a rip  off  and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role . but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story  they  ve decided to rip  off some   s slasher flicks like  nightmare on elm street  as well and surprisingly enough  this actually works . the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer  and instead of trying to scare the audience to death  they  ve created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie . there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn  t able to fully ignore  the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie . spoiler ahead i mean  they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene  it makes no sense i tell you . end of spoilers . all in all  cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip  offs that never made it big . i  m surprised that this one never got a sequel  but i guess it simply came out too late .  br    br   suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares . cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it  s completely ludicrous .  \n",

      "what  s not to like about this movie  every year you know that you  re going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible . this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well . a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him . what is the good of having money like that if you can  t do fun things with it . it was a win  win situation . a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined . only if .  br    br   drew latham  ben affleck  was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands . it was a fun and funny movie .  \n",

      "surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released . ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas . he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer . i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past  though i did like daredevil and paycheck  but here he is well cast in this role . i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who can  t stand affleck  s character at first . sure you can see where this movie is going but you don  t care . ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies .  \n",

      "as with all of angelopoulos  films   the suspended step of the stork  implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer  a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work . dialogues are sparing  with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters  inner conflicts  doubts  or feelings . the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses  and instead forces them to explore and study the characters  identities for themselves . as a result  the acting is understated and implicit  as opposed to overt and explicit .  br    br   the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation  where the viewer is asked to become a participant  to participate as an actor  by probing his or her own psyche . as in a novel  where the drama rests entirely on the author  s writing to provide a template where the reader  s imagination and  or past experience flourish  angelopoulos  drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots  the long takes  the leisurely pacing  the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark  inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective . angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity  reverting to the non  verbal language of gestures  gazes  sounds  and music  when he believes that words can only take us so far .  br    br   the music  by angelopoulos  long time collaborator  eleni karaindrou  provides more than just a discreet background  but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story . a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle  subdued colors  recorded in a drab winter light . angelopoulos presents us with an  other greece   one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures  with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas  drowned in an eternal sunshine . here  the skies are covered and gray  the air is cold and misty  and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled  dirty snow of the village streets . angelopoulos  genius through arvanitis  camera is on display throughout the film .  br    br    the suspended step of the stork  is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio  political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century . it is deeply concerned with the meaning of  borders   and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations . in the  waiting room  facing the albanian border  the refugees  political or other  outcast by the rest of humanity  wait . they may be stuck against a political border  but unfortunately they still carry with them  and hang on  deeper ancestral borders those of the languages  of the customs  and of the races . although angelopoulos  political views are well known  the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees  plights . in the process  angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical  cultural  political  and personal  borders .   br    br   angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece  and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions . in this film  he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures  drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus  travel . alexander is a telemachus  in search of a story about an aging greek politician  odysseus who disappeared  never to be heard of again . this political man  a brilliant orator  unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence  his wife  and his brilliant career  to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low . he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world . of course  the  politician  is not alexander  s father  but the  politician  stands before alexander like a father figure  odysseus . as with homer  s telemachus  alexander grows as a person during his odyssey .  br    br   of course  it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer  s odyssey in a contemporary context . angelopoulos draws on odysseus  s travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film . in angelopoulos  ending   odysseus  is more like the dante  s odysseus he does not leave for ithaca but goes on   carrying a suitcase .  and alexander  telemachus is  suspended  between returning to his home and his career  or embarking on a voyage to  somewhere else .  he states as much  in a voice  over at the beginning of the film  paraphrasing few lines from dante  s  inferno    and don  t forget that the time for a voyage has come again . the wind blows your eyes far away .   br    br   finally  although angelopoulos is not a religious person  there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow  suited linesmen  who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications  and also the christ  like figure of the  politician .  in the final scene  these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography  s influence in angelopoulos  work . they appear like  stylites   religious figures found in the orthodox tradition  solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars  in a form of asceticism .  br    br   the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni . angelopoulos does not give us any clues  and the wife  s statement   it  s not him   is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough . the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician  but that he could be the politician . but the film still ends on an optimistic note . whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river  and thus communications across the border are still not possible  and it remains impenetrable  we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border  and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary . on this account  angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow  some of the borders will eventually crumble .  \n",

      "of all the kung  fu films made through the    s and    s this is one that has developed a real cult following . with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story . an aging kung  fu master tells his last pupil yang tieh  sheng chiang  about five pupils he has trained in the past . all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently . their specialty in kung  fu is the name they have adopted like lizard  snake  centipede  toad and scorpion . the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil . an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target . tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are . tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung  pai wei  and along with tang sen kue  feng lu  who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map . a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is . a local policeman named ho yung sin  philip kwok  investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow  chien sun  . sin has a friend called li ho  meng lo  who is the toad and they do know of each others identity . the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed . when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue .  br    br   this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films . chang was not your run of the mill kung  fu director and his films always had a special quality to them . while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme . even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that . five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks . then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is . very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves . i wouldn  t exactly put it in the same league as  enter the dragon  because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking . this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn  t necessarily about fight scenes . its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved . that alone makes this different from all the other kung  fu films . very well made with a unique story .  \n",
      "be careful with this one . once you get yer mitts on it  it  ll change the way you look at kung  fu flicks . you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung  fu films now  you will be wanting character depth and development  you will be craving mystery and unpredictability  you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops . sadly  you won  t find all of these aspects together in one kung  fu movie  except for five deadly venoms   br    br   easily the best kung  fu movie of all  time  venoms blends a rich plot  full of twists and turns  with colourful  and developed  characters  along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the   s . the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which  and who specializes in what venom . one is the centipede  two is the snake  three is the scorpion  four is the lizard  and five is the toad . each character has different traits  characteristics  strengths  and weaknesses . therein lies the hook  we learn along with the student character  finding out who these different men turn out to be . we are in his shoes  so to speak   and we have to pick who we trust  and who we don  t  just like he does . we learn along with him .  br    br   not only is the plot  the characters  and the camerawork great  it  s also fun to watch  which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it  s kind . it  s worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that  s going on . venoms is a lesson on what kung  fu can really do . . . just don  t expect many other kung  fu films to live up to it  s gauntlet .  \n",
      "after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly   years  i must say it did not lose any of its mysticism  nor any of its eye  popping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth . the story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his  unfinished  pupil out to find the  past members of his poison clan  so they do not seek out a fortune which the master  s friend keeps hidden . afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training  he instructs him to befriend one of the five  venoms  so as to defeat the other four .  br    br   i can  t say enough about the choreography or the camera work . a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made . a classic    \n",
      "well  i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie . despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy  and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason  i was not disappointed . the story was actually pretty interesting the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil  and who is using them for good . the catch being that during training  all of the clan were masked  and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names .  br    br   the fights are a joy to watch  as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style toad  my favorite   snake  scorpion  lizard  and centipede . the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place  and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action .  br    br   the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence . but stick with it  and you won  t be disappointed   \n",
      "most   s  and   s  kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few well  planned fight sequences  but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes   like porno films  really .  br    br   but this one does several things well . most overtly  there is the direction and choreography  which confines each combatant to a  style    it  s really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater  but the effect works .  br    br   second  there is the language of the camera  which uses some impressive techniques  even by today  s measure   changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion  and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future .  br    br   least overt  but most powerful and unexpected  is the construction . the winner of this contest is determined by who  unfolds  the story . the master  the writer  sets up a game where the lead character doesn  t know who he  s seeking  which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in . one by one  he figures out who is who  at the same rate we find out who is who . it all follows a tragedy  noir arc . the ending tends toward irony  a la  the sting  . much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre .  br    br   the  five venoms  idea is the template for tarantino  s  deadly viper assassins  from the  kill bill  volumes .  \n",
      "for all the hoopla  respect and recognition this film gets from kung fu historians  it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas action and fight scenes . but i must say that the plot is probably the best and most original i  ve ever seen in a martial arts film . five deadly venoms without a doubt is a must see  not only that  a movie you can watch again and again but i also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better . it somehow leaves you wanting something  you want more . the producer chang cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn  t follow through with giving us more of the action we want . the fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer  centipede  snake  scorpion  lizard  toad  and they are shown  but battles are noticeably short . the toad and snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much  much more  in fact the toad is killed off by the middle of the movie . interestingly enough with this movie  the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot  this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome . this movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe . sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel . to start off the movie and to introduce the poison clan producer chang cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon . the ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more . still though this movie is one of shaw brothers best and is quite enjoyable . my overall impression of the movie would conclude with this the styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail  sad thing is  the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn  t expand on it . i am left wondering what could have been with this movie  still one of the best though .  out of   on the scale .  \n",
      "seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately . this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic . i happened to see the dubbed version but i  m on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue . still  the dubbing didn  t get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour  poison clan rocks the world      br    br   the story  telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue  suspense  and inter  personal relationships . you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the  venoms are revealed and an expert pace .  br    br   the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed . it  s like watching real animals fight each other  but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms . such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema .  br    br   the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film  s genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution . . . . of course  if you just want to see people pummel each other  along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture  be my guest   \n",
      "the five deadly venoms is a great kung  fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery . there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung  fu flick great choreography  awful dubbing  different  styles  of fighting  and a wide range of greatly exaggerated  often cheesey human emotions . however the plot certainly is better than average . it  s interesting and holds your attention throughout the non  fight scenes . occasionally it  s even able to fire up the audience  such as when x character receives horrible injustice .  br    br   another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie  s morals and themes . just about everyone gets what  s coming to them . the cowardly  greedy  and corrupt lose out . the bad guys  consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing . the good guys use teamwork  planning  and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top .  br    br   poison clan rocks   \n",
      "i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv .  br    br   the one scene that always stands out  for me that is  is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman  where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says  did you get that  that  s yellow  blue  green and white   \n",
      "this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever  and may be one of the best movies ever . . . it  s got a great plot that functions like a puzzle  with lots of intrigue and suspense . this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions  with people hiding their identities and their natures . the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters . they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality  s and desires .  br    br   the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting . it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy . there are  members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal . the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film . . . when this happens  the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel . these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely .  br    br   one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death . the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death . this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective . we actually care when people are killed in this film . this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed . some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching . when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain .  br    br   at the same time  this is also a fun movie . it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film . there is bad dubbing  the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat . some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic . . . all this just adds to the greatness of the film .  br    br   and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries . if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic . everything goes by so fast  because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre  that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is . the lighting and composition are spectacular at times . the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing . . . in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example  imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed . chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it  s confines . he doesn  t rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film  but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work . he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people .  br    br   this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level . it  s art  it  s trash  it  s emotionally moving  and it  s fun  it has a true sense of morality  but doesn  t allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action . i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not .  \n",
      "the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first . the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off . however  i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem . i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy   sarah  s character is a true sociopath  very comparable to sedaris  jerri blank .  br    br   the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast . her sister  s character is good funny at times  but ultimately meant not to steal sarah  s show . however  the rest of the cast is extremely sub  par in comparison .  br    br   i  m glad  though  that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor .  \n",

      "following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use . the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah  s erratic persona which  beyond general insensitivity  has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on  making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene . sarah  s ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed . every time she speaks it  s like a self  contained  second skit . she overemotes a lot  demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify  but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied . this may be the most creative  original and experimental tv program ever .  \n",
      "first and foremost i would like to say that i  m a huge sarah silverman fan  and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me . everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form  maybe not directly funny  but the situation and the delivery are what counts .  br    br   if you liked jesus is magic then i don  t see how you wouldn  t like this . it has that same flow and that same rhythm . true it  s only for the true fans  but if you are you  ll be pleased .  br    br   again only for the true fans  there  s no way around that . if you  re not used to her style then you wouldn  t get why this is funny . however  it is  and i hope you think so too .  \n",

      "i originally scored sarah  s show with a nice fat   but i  ve struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin  is what  s settled in . i shall explain .  br    br   you will either like sarah  s humor  or you won  t . if you don  t  i doubt anyone could persuade you . you folks know who you are and it  s perfectly fine  but then you know that too . moving on  the first season gave us fantastic bits about sarah  her friends and family  and her pursuits in life . in one memorable episode  she is  pulled over  by officer jay whom she meets for the first time .   do you know why i am standing here   he asks .  because you got all c  s in high school   she quizzically replies . it seemed to be a genuine question .  that is funny stuff in my book . sarah can come at you from odd angles . in another episode  her affair with god was notably funny . god being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke . it is clever  it is a twisted view  but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed .  br    br   then  came the second season . while still not without some new and inventive comedy  we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal poop and fart jokes  quite simply . i get some good laughs here and there  but much of it seems like filler while she  and the writers  struggle to foment some original material . sophomoric and tiresome are the feelings i have for the episodes lately  but i have been gutting it out for the gems i do find  the turtle  and waiting for her to turn it around . i was a fan of her  jesus is magic  routine and would like to think that i understand what she is capable of . let  s get back to that .  \n",
      "for those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity  you are in fact the mindless one . while the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems  racial barriers  clich  s  stereotypes etc . you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it .  br    br   what i also love is that not everything is a punchline . for those expecting a formulated joke like friends  i love friends fyi   you won  t find it here . instead sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic . we don  t walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said  which is in most comedies . instead the sarah silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense .  br    br   so don  t take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that .  \n",

      "when it first came out  this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation . luckily  it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema  especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television  and the bad evolution of most direct cinema .  br    br   really  at first  we must say that this isn  t really direct cinema  it is more cinema verit . the difference between the two is very slight  but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary  we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers  and they do interact with the characters filmed . this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation . the meysels have been allowed in the house  and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household . and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed .  br    br   it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews . here  we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house  a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith . their house is a mess  litter and animals everywhere  faded colors and furniture all over the house  and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality . these two people have lived with each other their whole life  and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention  but rather because they can  t help talking to each other this way . they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings  there is no need . in the end  though  even as they blame each other for their lives  they really love each other deeply . edie says she doesn  t want her mother to die  because she loves her very much  and edith says that she doesn  t want edie to leave her because she doesn  t want to be alone .  br    br   but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age  the two women can  t help be girls . they cannot help being one the singer  the other the dancer . exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera . when edie asks david meysels rhetorically  where have you been all my life   she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills . a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again  the way only the meysels and few others could do .  \n",
      "little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for . even though their house was filthy  this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness . on the message board a poster wrote that  little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old .  this reminded me of when in the dramatized     version  big edie says to little edie   if you  re stuck  it  s only with yourself   these women had everything beauty  talent  intelligence  firm belief in their opinions and actions . perhaps if little edie wasn  t so hard on herself the first time things didn  t work out  losing her hair  her job  and the love of her life  she would have made it . this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead . the world will never know what have happened if she didn  t listen to her mom  s plea   come home  edie  let me take care of you    br    br   yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant  heartbreaking  and lovable  even in their extremely filthy home . these women were extraordinary  and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness . when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns  dwelling about what could have been  or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl  one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that  everything will be okay    br    br   great documentary    br    br        \n",

      "i saw this film a couple of weeks ago  and it  s been stuck in my head ever since . it stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary . to get the true story of the beales  i had to wade through all of the dvd  s bonus material and commentaries and search the web .  br    br   although the maysles and their fans  not to mention edith and edie themselves  bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative  this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word . very little effort is every made to explain the beales or how they came to the condition they were in  the maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edie to say something outrageous . the sound  even on the criterion re  release is poor and difficult to follow . although i appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film  it  s ironic to compare it to geraldo rivera  s    far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at willowbrook state school in staten island from      four years before grey gardens was shot .  br    br   to paraphrase a review in the new yorker  there were many things edith and edie needed in their lives  and a documentary wasn  t one of them .  br    br   as for edith and edie  the thing i kept thinking while watching the film was  where the hell is their family   they were living in dangerous  unhealthy  unsafe conditions . how is it that jackie o  married to one of the richest men on earth  or the wealthy bouvier family themselves  couldn  t afford to get edith and edie a decent home  or at the very least hire a part  time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both  it  s shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire bouvier family .  br    br   although this review may sound negative i would strongly recommend grey gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries . perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary  bringing in the rich backstory  and afterstory  of the beales and the whole subsection of hamptons society in the      s .  \n",
      "hey now  yours truly  theatrex  found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market  in almost new condition  and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a  cult hit  so of course it came home with me .  br    br   what a strange film . the aunt and cousin of former first lady jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis live in this decaying   room house out on long island  suffolk co .  and share the house with raccoons  cats  fleas  eyow   and who knows what else . suffolk co . was all over them at one point for living in filth and old jackie herself came by to set things right . anyway  this is one strange pair  big edie and little edie . . . edie  the daughter  always wears something over her head and dances  sings  and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense . big edie  the mother  age    apparently likes to run around naked  and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully    done to the point where we  re mercifully spared from that . these women talk and talk and talk  mostly about the past  and it doesn  t make a whole lot of sense  except to them . they live in absolute filth  cats doing their business wherever   look  that cat  s going to the bathroom behind my portrait     and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations . if i close my eyes and listen to big edie  s voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt  who was from that area of the country and had that lawn guyland accent . one scene has little edie putting on flea repellent  lovely  you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested . the box refers to these two women as  eccentric   and i  d have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for  wacked out of their gourds   but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them . this is equal parts creepy  sad  and disgusting  but i couldn  t stop watching once i started . this is not my  normal  type of flick but i found it to be somewhat fascinating . it won  t be for everybody though  guaranteed .  \n",

      "  cypher  is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future . while thematically not complex  this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty  ruthlessness  and corporate conspiracy . to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf .  br    br   the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man  morgan sullivan  jeremy northam   who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative . after an initial briefing with digicorp  s security chief  sullivan is then given a new identity  jack thursby  and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies . upon successfully completing his first assignment  sullivan  thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered . however  on one of his  business trips  he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster   liu  whom he had met on his previous assignment  and from there things go extremely topsy  turvy . the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp  s espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp  s main competitors  thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies .  br    br     spoilers end here    br    br   what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes . vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic  household settings  while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover  up . i was also very impressed with jeremy northam . not too often have i seen him in the lead role  and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant . personally  i think he  s one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn  t been given more challenging roles . lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak  and  dagger tone . additionally  the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job  however  my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated . for example  i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second  wife .  overall  this is a cleverly developed cloak  and  dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted . with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work  this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future . i  m surprised that i had never watched this  hidden gem  before . this is a brilliant  not  too  overly complicated spy thriller  and therefore i  m giving it a  out of   .  \n",

      "cypher is a clever  effective and eerie film that delivers . its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands . although one could immediately label the film a science fiction  there is a little more to it . it has it  s obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir  detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story .  br    br   the film  overall  plays out like it  s some kind of nightmare thus building and retaining a good atmosphere . we  re never sure of what exactly is going on  we  re never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we  re not entirely sure of certain people  similar to having a dream  the ambiguity reigns over us all  hero included and i haven  t seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before  bar terry gilliam  s brazil . going with the eeriness stated earlier  cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective  noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there  s something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well .  br    br   there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story . the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster  liu   who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale  can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero people whom appear as friends actually aren  t  people who say they  re helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look . despite a lot of switching things around  twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they  re not carried out the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy liu  s character  and she  s trying to help out    the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage  spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents . the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini  cold war something that resembles the u . s . a . and the u . s . s . r . in their war of word  s heyday and it really pulls through given the black  bleak  often cgi littered screen that i was glued to .  br    br   what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations  significant then how the more he acts on his and foster  s own motivation this sequence disappears because he  s breaking away from the computerised  repetitive  controlled life that he  s being told to live and is branching out .  br    br   cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film . to say it resembles the first jason bourne film  only set in the sci  fi genre  isn  t cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities despite them both being released in the same year . like i mentioned earlier  there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict  you will find yourself enjoying this film .  \n",

      "it  s actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond  as i  m sure he wouldn  t be able to keep up in the nowadays spying  business  where fast cars have been replaced with hi  tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment .  cypher  is a pretty inventive sci  fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright  claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible . you know the trend in these types of movies nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot  the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again . the events in  cypher  supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world  where the major companies don  t really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other  s thunder . company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity  only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor  the sunways corporation . sunways  on the other hand  constantly tries to unmask the digisoft  rats and recruit them again as double  spies . in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan a seemingly colorless thirty  something employee who  s been selected by sebastian rooks  the ber  spy  to diddle the secret policies of both companies . trust me  it  s actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali  the dude from  tube   carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters . the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem  seconds   starring rock hudson  as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style . even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that    s film  with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless . there  s also plenty of great action and suspense  most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing  techniques during boring conventions . the middle section of the film drags a little  mainly because you already realize that it  s all just building up towards multiple misleading plot  twists  and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not  so  distant future . jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side . regular director  s choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c . dunn .  cypher  is well made and adrenalin rushing sci  fi entertainment  highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time .  \n",

      "canadian director vincenzo natali took the art  house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube  which is my personal favourite sf film of the   s . it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube  shot entirely on one set  and took this idea in fascinating directions .  br    br   i  ve been eagerly awaiting natali  s follow  up  and although its taken five years for him to mount another project  i  m delighted to say it was worth the wait . cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man  s place in the world  and how through a completely logical chain of events  finds himself in a situation beyond his control .  br    br   i don  t want to reveal too much about the plot  because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down . it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it  s head . cypher is such a film .  br    br   morgan sullivan  jeremy northam   one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet  is hired by the company digicorp . they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars . to his bewilderment  they are unbelievably boring . covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese .  br    br   while morgan is waiting for one seminar  he runs into rita foster  an impeccably cast lucy liu   the definition of an ice maiden . she gives him the brush  off  but there is something to her he finds irresistible . that  s not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in .  br    br   when rita turns up at another one of morgan  s seminars  she tells him his life is not what it appears . and i  m not saying anything more about the plot . to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us  as well as the tortuous path that  s so much fun to follow .  br    br   as with cube  natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people  taking them out of the familiar  and basically seeing what will happen when they  re thrust into the unknown . and cypher follows similar patterns . but it  s not a carbon copy of cube . it has it  s own inspiration .  br    br   cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories . one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge . when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle  it  s as much of a shock to us as it is to him .  br    br   one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is . where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns  cypher is also on a low budget  but natali economises it as much as he can  allowing him to broaden the horizon  and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity .  br    br   natali  s direction is exceptional  with a deft hand on the reins . there are some amazing camera angles from above  such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast  robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside . all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture  which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film  noir .  br    br   the acting is uniformly excellent throughout . jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity . his performance is excellent because it  s so modulated . he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes . from a clinical  spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity .  br    br   david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube . he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black . his scene is one of the best because it  s an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia . he is a supposed expert in identifying double  agents  and it  s a fantastic piece of writing  brilliantly acted by hewlett . all he has to do is look at morgan  and we  re drawn into his complex mind game .  br    br   but it  s lucy liu who  s the scene stealer here . too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect . but in cypher  she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove . rita is an aloof  guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish . i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control  and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone .  br    br   things come to a very gratifying end  that doesn  t conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did . but morgan deserves his happy ending . after he  s been put through the ringer like this  i cheered for him in the final scene . it  s a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy   minutes .  br    br   cypher succeeds on all counts . engaging  shocking  always entertaining  it  s everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn  t . and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix .  br    br   a fine follow  up from natali . and now i  m a committed fan of the man . superb stuff   \n",

      "this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci  fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali . the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen . the film is superbly shot  i love the cinematography in this  it feels fresh and original . plot  wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall  dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci  fi stuff . morgan sullivan  jeremy northam  is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp  a large technological corporation . he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do . it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen . it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife . after his first job things become strange  his habits change  his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares . he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster  played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu .  he takes an instant attraction to . however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems . he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp . the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies . sullivan  whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain  dead day dream while the speakers drone on  the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages .  suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else . digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence . sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby . digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it  they now effectively control what these spies do  except for sullivan . when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp  make sullivan a double agent . they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down . samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system . the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn . he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him . when a mysterious third party becomes involved  the person it is revealed that foster works for  sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent  who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for . the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires . the cast are great . northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent . he brings a great visual aspect to his performance  his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby . lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact . the rest of the cast are also good .  br    br   director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci  fi flick cube  has a real visual flair . he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look . for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn  t great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively . the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci  fi films  it is up there with them . the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this  that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident . the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along . this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states .      br    br    \n",
      "this filmfour funded sci  fi movie is most definitely a must see . while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise it  s handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive  despite it being basically a re  run of an earlier film . it  s good to know that films like this are still being made  even if they aren  t getting wide releases   and cypher is refreshing for that reason . the plot twists and turns  which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher  s mystery . the plot follows morgan sullivan a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons  to him  unknown . however  his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita . . .  br    br   this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it  s apocalyptic imaging of the future . this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type  with it  s only real close affiliate being kubrick  s a clockwork orange . the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish  and more thrilling  plot developing . you never quite know where you are with the plot  which serves in making it all the more intriguing . the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars jeremy northam and lucy lui . northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale  and does well with his role . lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn  t quite fit her talent  but she has a look about her that just fits this movie .  br    br   cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent but on the whole  if you want an inventive recent sci  fi film cypher is the way to go .  \n",
      "jeremy northam  s characterization of the stuttering  mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu  s presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch . his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit  done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face  neck and lips . no matter the brainwashing  love has a way of persevering . love also cannot be  brainwashed in  with either of his two fake wives . in gradual stages  he begins to dispense with his glasses  to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses . the music is fantastic  hypnotic  sexy and appropriately driving at times . the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi  film noir  in the tradition of many classic thrillers . i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu  s portrayal  whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states  the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith  some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part . she is just no match for northam  s talents  but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author .  \n",

knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody double  crosses are completely unexpected . as roger ebert has observed  the stuntman who made the mid  air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition .  br    br   later  during the avalanche sequence  one of the terrorists  thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain . so far as i know  no one was killed in the making of this movie  a small miracle  considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts   so obviously a dummy was used for the shot . but the shot itself remains impressive because we  re left wondering how harlin  or more likely one of the second  unit directors  knew exactly where to place the camera .  br    br   i  ll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week  because he  s one of the few movie stars i  ve ever seen who  s completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain  and at the same time actually feels that pain . the role of gabe walker really complements stallone  s acting strengths he plays an older  more vulnerable kind of action hero  giving an impressively low  key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself .  br    br   in contrast to many of today  s post  matrix  comic book  inspired action heroes  stallone  s walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer  enhanced abilities . in cliffhanger  the hero almost freezes to death  and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another . he winces when he  s hit and bleeds when he  s cut  particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky  style pummeling from one of the mad  dog villains .  br    br   it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie  s effectiveness when i first saw this movie as a teenager  i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust  or rather  the ice   at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold  blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise .  br    br   lithgow  s british accent is as unconvincing as the movie  s occasional model plane or model helicopter  but he  s fundamentally a good actor  and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene  looking at his hostages stallone and rooker  trying to decide which tasks to give them  he actually says  you  stay  you  fetch   even a better actor  such as anthony hopkins  might have had trouble with that line .  br    br   even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside  it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show .  br    br   early in the movie  for example  lithgow openly says to one of his men  retire stallone when he comes down .  no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face  and this precipitates a gripping tug  of  war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg .  br    br   lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means  but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn  t given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor .  br    br   done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or  at times  a western  cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film .  br    br   besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before  the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow  as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action  packed narrative . finally  harlin  s decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless  since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes .  br    br   it  s a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies  because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later . but perhaps it  s best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time  without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already . there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit compared to that clinker  cliffhanger belongs on the imdb  s top    list .  br    br   rating   very good  especially considering most of stallone  s other movies .   \n",

      "french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene . malfique preceded the revival just slightly  but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made  malfique was obviously shot on a low budget  but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film  and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner . the plot focuses on two main ideas prison and black magic . the central character is a man named carrre  sent to prison for fraud . he is put in a cell with three others the quietly insane lassalle  body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy . after a short while in the cell together  they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal . after translating part of it  they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls .  br    br   black magic is a very interesting topic  and i  m actually quite surprised that there aren  t more films based on it as there  s so much scope for things to do with it . it  s fair to say that malfique makes the best of it  s assets as despite it  s restraints  the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout . director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic  and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell  it  s very easy to get behind them  it  s often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people  and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner  and this helps to ensure that malfique actually does manage to be quite frightening  the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done . anyone worried that the film won  t deliver by the end won  t be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying  overall  malfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade  highly recommended viewing   \n",
      "malfique is a very interesting movie . it is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures . the central concept is great  three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth  who the audience identify with  and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell .  br    br   the atmosphere is well  woven  it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of edmond dantes  in the chteau d  if  prior to becoming the count of monte cristo  . the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell  particularly the character we are meant to identify with  carrre  a white  collar criminal whose crime is not specified  but it  s obliquely suggested might be fraud  . on one occasion carrre dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him we never leave the cell  the claustrophobia is unbroken . there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell  and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall . so even though the film appears to be very modern  it has a very old world feel of incarceration .  br    br   the characters are intriguing . we have marcus  a violent pre  op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to pquerette  french for daisy  a heavily retarded young man . pquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful  and unfortunately this included his baby sister  hence his current predicament  i like this comment on internalisation  very primitive  . lasalle is a withdrawn  possessed elderly man  in for brutally murdering his wife .  br    br   the central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you  and there  s a ritual that goes with that . i think that  s what disturbs me the most  seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically . it has a real life ring to it . the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well  every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong . i  m actually hearing the gong now every time i do something self  destructive .  br    br   i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don  t really reinforce the message consistently  particularly with carrre  also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film  not in terms of a successive revelation either . i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish  more by design than execution  such as the famous  vagina eye   and the sodomy of lasalle  for me  totally hollow images .  br    br   at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with  and some things don  t seem logical  for example we  ve been clumsily led to believe different things about carrre  s child . this doesn  t change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird  a  pure  horror movie . there is no comedic dross or genre segueing  like cube       natali   the obvious movie to compare it to  it  s a total immersion experience  where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters . this last comment i make about it being a  pure  experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point .  br    br   on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when lasalle talks about his past as a librarian . he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him . the books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge . this prompts lasalle to go insane . that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge . it  s something i myself have felt .  br    br   one final comment is that two of the quite well  received comments on the board have confused the characters  names . to convince yourself that lasalle is the older librarian character  simply click on philippe laudenbach  s page and you will see he was born in     .  \n",

      "if you  re one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as  book of the dead    book of eibon  or  necronomicon   then you should feel right at home with malefique  a film which also features an occult tome  one with the power to change the destinies of all involved . discovered by four french prisoners sharing a cell  the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by danvers  a serial killer incarcerated back in the     s a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished . finders of the book are carrre  grald laroche  a company embezzler shopped by his wife  lassalle  philippe laudenbach  who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body  builds to execute an escape plan  the halfwit pquerette  dimitri rataud  who once ate his baby sister  and the  librarian  marcus  clovis cornillac   supposedly driven mad by reading  who murdered his wife . reminding the viewer of meat loaf  s equally bizarre  bosomy male in fight club        lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet  one who is especially protective of the infantile pquerette . with the coming of the book however  and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents  marcus assumes greater and greater significance . at first assured of an early bail  meanwhile carrre takes little more than academic interest in events . suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and  as the prisoners experiment  danvers  book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers . . .  br    br   staged for the most part within a prison cell  and between four or five characters  malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter  as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers  . only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell  a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed  closed  in nature of proceedings elsewhere . more than anything  this is a film about being trapped  either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding .  i  m going to escape   says carrre at the start of the film  wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son . whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price  and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an  escape  may not be one a man might imagine .  br    br   with all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first  time feature director eric vallette  s credit that his film succeeds as well as it does . as critics have noticed  it is a film with strong freudian overtones  lassalle  s distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus danvers  original placenta fetish the dark cell as a primitive womb from which  delivery  is awaited  etc . with so many interesting aspects to the script vallette hardly puts a foot wrong  and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what  when one comes down to it  is just a matter of four guys  four bunks  one folding table and a book . there  s a genuine  growing  lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages  while one or two moments  the aforementioned blinking vagina  or what ultimately happens to pquerette  are unsettlingly memorable . the pacing of many of the dark events in malefique is deliberate  rejecting the rapid cutting of many hollywood productions a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick  fix action and gore . perhaps this is a particularly european manner  as one recalls a similar  measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as verhoeven  s the fourth man        a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye .  br    br   lensed well in  .      malefique benefits from excellent performances and  if for this viewer at least  the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been  the journey to the final shot was worth taking . coming so soon after the release of the similarly well  received haute tension  aka switchblade romance        this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the french industry  this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from asia  \n",
      "the film opens with bill coles  melvyn douglas  telling a story about how his best friend   make that client   jim blandings  cary grant  and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment  with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms . when jim  s wife  muriel  myrna loy   wants to renovate the apartment  advertising exec jim falls in love with  or falls for   an ad for a house . once he  s purchased the house  bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jim  s  dream house  goes wrong .  br    br   one of three collaborations between grant and loy  this is a charming little comedy   not very taxing  with no real great message  but a great way to spend an hour or two . the laughs are there right from the start  when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off  only to be thwarted at every turn by muriel . the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros  and that  s just what grant and loy give us polished performances  simple chemistry  and a lot of fun . myrna loy is in a pretty thankless role  it  s evident that grant  s character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting  and grant  as always  pulls both off with remarkable aplomb   but she gives muriel a colour  life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character . melvyn douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well  never hitting a single wrong note .  br    br   one of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the  store room   and jim goes to  save  him . . . only to get everyone trapped inside  every little problem that pops up for the blandings renovation project   including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for  wham    seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch .      \n",

      "  malfique  is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well  executed plot and a lot of heart . its cast doesn  t have recognized names  it doesn  t have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well  written script  an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills . eric valette may not be a well  know name yet  but with  malfique   his feature length debut  he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet  gans or aja .  br    br   the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell  four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal to get out . carrre  grald laroche  gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi  millionaire fraud his cell  mates  the violent marcus  clovis cornillac   the intellectual lassalle  philippe laudenbach  and the mentally challenged pquerette  dimitri rataud   are all convicted for murder and give carrre a cold welcome . their personalities will clash as carrre discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic .  br    br   written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier   malfique  is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barker  s stories . the movie  s strongest point is the way it builds up the characters  they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities . the story  s supernatural element is very well  handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel . despite being a movie about four men locked in a room  the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact  the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust  claustrophobia  and specially  paranoia .  br    br   director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere  mood and his cast to give life to the plot . despite its obvious lack of budget  he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original  fresh and very attractive . his subtle and effective camera  work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location  and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot . the very few displays of special effects are very well  done and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore .  br    br   the characters are what make this film work  and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit . grald laroche is excellent as carrre  a man at first sight innocent  but who hides a dark past . philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too  specially rataud in his very demanding role . however  is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus  a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself . the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them .  br    br   the movie is terrific  but it is not without its share of flaws . of course  the most notorious one is its the low  budget . some of the cgi  effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make  up and prosthetics used in other scenes  however  it is never too bad for it . probably the bad thing about  malfique  is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters  not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view .  br    br   anyways   malfique  is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately  and one that deserves to have more recognition . valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest  albeit complex  tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities . personally  this film is a new favorite .      \n",

      "this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail . there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven  t come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one . this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film . at first  the action seems rather off  the  wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves  even if grudgingly  through each other . rogers  heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedy  s angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them . you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it  s in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread . hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt .  \n",

      "aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie  i think i  ve watched every movie guy ritchie has directed . twice . needless to say  i  m a big fan and revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why . this movie is a very different approach from ritchie  when you look at it comparatively with lock  stock . . . and snatch . revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didn  t expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn  t know he needed . along with seeing andr benjamin of outkast fame strut his acting ability  other standout acts are ray liotta playing the maniacal mr . d  macha and mark strong playing sorter  the hit  man .  br    br   after being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner  macha  jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent . when he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from macha  jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that  s left him with three days to live . a team of loan sharks  however  have an answer for him and a ticket to life  only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them  all in a ploy to both take macha down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself . along with having the air of death loom  and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money  jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him  which introduces sorter  a hit  man under macha  s employ . the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co  convicts he spent time with in solitary may very  well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into . when faced with this reality though  zack  vincent pastore  and avi show jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary  having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to jake . the movie unravels to a humbling process for both jake and macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons .  br    br   the style of the movie is top  notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes . although a lot of nods at ritchie  s previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue  the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre . it  s also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should . the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and  true to ritchie fashion  they  re all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone  s affairs . i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i don  t want to take too much away from it if you haven  t seen it yet .  br    br   it may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it  s a great movie and it should be seen . if you  re lucky and you haven  t seen the watered  down us release  see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take . i saw it with my crew around early      and we  re still talking about it with little things we  ve picked up on today . it has garnered its cult status  and it  s well  deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit .  br    br   standout line  fear or revere me  but please  think i  m special . we share an addiction . we  re approval junkies .   \n",

      "if you are a fan of altman  s large ensemble casts  as evidenced in major films like m . a . s . h .  nashville  gosford park  and lesser seen films like a wedding  then you will no doubt be entertained by health . centered around a health convention where two women are running for president  health contains many of altman  s latter   s regulars like paul dooley  who helped write the film   carol burnett  and henry gibson  while also including top star altman newcomers like lauren bacall  james garner  and glenda jackson . like a lot of altman ensemble films there are numerous subplots in this film  but it is not nearly as overwhelming as films like nashville or a wedding  rather it has a more centered feel  perhaps like m . a . s . h . or gosford park . the whole thing is an obvious satire on the health movement  filled with over  top  outlandish  contradictive characters  with guest stars like dick cavett providing a wry commentary on the whole thing . underlining the whole election process is altman  s characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having . this would be one of altman  s last films like this for a while   \n",

      "it  s all very simple . jake goes to prison  and spends five years with the con and the chess masters . they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure  and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks . they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom from his innermost fears  from what he believes to be himself . for that  they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear  all the pride  all the hope  to be reborn as true master of his will .  br    br   it  s a clever movie about the journey of illumination  about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves .       no doubt .  \n",

      "neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist  revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers . but then  nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew  especially one using the gangster  con  artist movie framework . as might be expected from luc besson  s name on the credits as producer  there  s a definite element of  cinema de look  about it set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap  it looks great  has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style  all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment . but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck  and he  s spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life  the universe and everything . if anything its problem is that he  s trying to throw in too many influences  a bit of machiavelli  a dash of godard  a lot of the principles of chess   motifs and techniques  littering the screen with quotes the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims  and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn  t want to turn into a movie . rather than a commercial for kabbalism  it  s really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce  chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film  s central  somewhat metaphysical  con .  br    br   the last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy  literally  within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people  s exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger  but it  s got a lot going for it all the same . not worth starting a new religion over  but i  m surprised it didn  t get a us distributor . maybe they found ray liotta  s intentionally fake tan just too damn scary   \n",
      "having read the reviews for this film  i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good . however  this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time . the majority of reviews that i had read  said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow . and whilst some parts do leave you confused  the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you  ve missed so much . it  s not like  lock  stock . . .  or  snatch   in the sense that it isn  t that funny  in fact  it  s pretty dark   and it is a lot more intelligent  in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints  and  in one of the best scenes of the film  jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself  . the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned  is that it is full of memorable characters  specifically statham  who gives a fantastic performance as the lead  and ray liotta  who spends most of the film in speedos  but gives a great performance none the less . if you  ve got time  and have time afterwards to think about the film  and even watch it again  you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film . i think it  s fantastic  and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game .  \n",
      "i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone  the fact is it wasn  t what anyone was expecting  especially from guy ritchie . what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners  do ya like dags   etc  but this is far more mature than his previous works . i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder  this film demands all your attention  look past the cool and dazzling look of the film  try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film .  br    br   yes this has its influences from modern classics  fight club  pulp fiction etc  but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none . i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney  masterpieces  .  \n",
      "first of all  don  t go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock  this is a different sort of gangster film .  br    br   i saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience . it  s the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that  that was awful  and the other half will leave thinking what was that  that was cool . personally i like films that i don  t understand  i . e . mullholland drive  and usual suspects  so i enjoyed revolver .  br    br   it definitely wasn  t perfect though . i saw the big twist coming a mile away  at least part of it  and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good  revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed . also some scenes  like the animation  and the scene where sorter goes on a killing spree  actually one of my favourites   although  awesome scenes to watch  seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch  not because they fit in with the movie .  br    br   however there were many good things too . i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors  jason stratham  ray liotta  vincent pastore  and even andre benjamin  who was a pleasant surprise  . this movie definitely kept my interest  with one great  suspenseful  action packed  scene after another . when ray liotta was being held under the table wow . . . . well you have to see it . the script was extremely well done  and the soundtrack  as with most guy ritchie films  was great .  br    br   though a step below such movies as  fight club  mullholland drive  and usual suspects  it was still an awesome fast paced  psychological  action movie  with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over .  \n",
      "i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away . it is a real masterpiece of art and i don  t understand why most of the people think it  s garbage . the main idea of the movie  take your ego away and then you will have true power  this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way .  the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look   do you remember this from the movie  because our true enemy is in us  it is our ego . . . that voice that always tells us that we are important  that gives us our pride  that tells us not to give  but only to take  that creates our aggression  that wants to be in control  that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts . gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance . a superb movie   \n",

      "first of all  when people hear  guy ritchie   they immediately think of snatch . yes  snatch was a good movie  but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch . they don  t expect him to explore new frontiers . this movie revolver is different than snatch it  s much darker and is very complex . the reason i gave a rating of   is because i  ve had to watch revolver  times to understand everything . so this movie toys with your head . it  s very cleverly written .  br    br   this movie is different than snatch . it was done wonderfully  the cinematography is beautiful  and you can recognize guy ritchie  s personal touch  style of directing  in it .  br    br   what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers .  \n",
      "ok . . . this movie so far has been slated by critics and board  posters alike  although playing devil  s advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn  t make it for themselves as film  makers  and board posters are often people who didn  t make it for themselves as critics  so i wanted to sit in guy  s corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who  ve decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it .  br    br   the film  s biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is . this has been described many times as as making the film  inaccessible  to the viewer . the film  s chronology is relatively non  linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle  or not so subtle  hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory  ie . ray liotta  s character brandishing a gun saying the words  fear me  is portrayed as both tragically pathetic  from statham  s pov  or interrogating and bold  from liotta  s pov  . this is but one example of ritchie  s far more mature approach he has taken to film  making with revolver  we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal  the strong but silent gritty anti  hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption . . . i mean it  s paint by numbers film noir here guys  all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice  overs  but then guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points .  br    br   take the scene where jason statham  s character runs afoul of a car . this throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever . . . but ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death .  br    br   so the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling  i  d be taking the pss if i said i didn  t spend the last   minutes or so of the film turning to my date going  uh . . . wtf   . . . but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art . it is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand . and even easier to say  well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film   . in my humble opinion  revolver is a stylish  complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the saatchi brothers . if we choose this opportunity to collectively say  ah sht  i wanted a film about a load of bleeding  cockney gangsters in  nit loll . . . guy ritchie is a tit   then the day will come when film  makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow  crappy people . just because guy made a name for himself with funny  cheeky cockney romps  doesn  t mean he can  t be deep without being  pretentious  . funny people can be thoughtful too .  \n",

      "i recommend families if possible  to show this to older children only . some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle . now that thats out of the way  let me explain about this movie . this is in reality a documentary of a male fox  who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate . the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score  is breath taking . you had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible  it  ll get ugly later . they gave both the fox and the vixen names  but i can  t remember what they are for the likes of me . he fights off this invading male  to win her love . they later on create a den  and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubsone of which is blind . there are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family  but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon . the first victim is the blind pup  who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away . the second victim is the mother  who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole . she unknowingly walks into a foot trap . while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot  causing her to bleed to death . the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree . the male is now a single dad  forced to take on the roll of mom and dad . he alone has to teach them the skills they need for life . it later proves not to be enough  when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man . i won  t spoil the surprising ending for you  but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail . and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through . i wanted to say that i saw this when it first came out in early     s  when we had a thing called showbiz cable . i was only  when i saw it  but i could never understand why they wouldn  t let me see all of it . now i know why  after i secretly watched it when it came on disney  when i was  . i felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on . i was moved to tears . but as dark and ugly as it was  it serves a purpose . to let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals  and why they are endangered . this documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species  and i hoped it worked . its not fake like the true life nature films by disney  they don  t teach about why animals are going extinct . the encroachment of land  the killing off of the foxes main prey  and senseless killing of these beautiful animalshas resulted in them becoming endangered . i wish they would make sequel to this movie   glacier fox      to see if they  re being treated better . maybe have it be about a vixen pup named teresa and her siblings growing up . this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes  especially when one of the parents suddenly dies . the surviving parent takes on the roll of both  and tries to teach the important lessons of life . it isn  t always enough to protect them when they  re adults  especially when some of their lives becomes ruined . or they fall victims to tragedy themselves . best all around soundtrack and musical score i  ve ever heard .  \n",

      "this slick and gritty film consistently delivers . it  s one of frankenheimer  s best and most underrated films and it  s easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date  and if you are scratching your head thinking  but i loved get shorty  you need to be punched in the face  . in my opinion  no one captures the  feel  for leonard  s characters better then john glover in   pick  up . the relocation of the story from detroit  novel  to hollywood  film  elevates the story  s sleaze factor to amazing heights . be a man  have a few beers and watch this movie . for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are swag  rum punch  cat chaser  city primeval  and   pick  up . my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate . i also have a real special place in my cold  movie heart for dead bang and black sunday .  \n",
      "i  ve always liked this john frankenheimer film . good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasn  t just another thriller is because of frankenheimer . his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference  he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant  you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made . i  ve always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance . clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and he  s excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out . frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail  murder  sex  drugs  and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts . what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped  a guilty pleasure to say the least . vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance . a classic exploitive thriller that shouldn  t be forgotten .  \n",

      "the sopranos stands out as an airtight  dynamic exploration of american life  and how the american experience is shaped and defined by money . by setting the story in the milieu of the underworld  david chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt  low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post  modern era .  br    br   every character represents a facet of american industry . tony soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff  torn between familial duty and a need to keep his  business  on an even keel . the convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward . the characters of christopher  paulie  and bobby reflect the loyal  but self  serving underlings present in every enterprise  who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit . with the character of ralph  joe pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath  a twisted businessman who  s flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power . and dominic chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old  guard  which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up  and  comers to deflect blame .  br    br   though abrasive and occasionally disturbing  the sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate tv drama .  br    br   ps a good companion piece to chase  s series would be the shield  another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting .  \n",

      "the sopranos is perhaps the most mind  opening series you could possibly ever want to watch . it  s smart  it  s quirky  it  s funny  and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can  t resist watching . the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters  set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families . for most of the time  you really don  t know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back  or buy them lunch .  br    br   further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities  these are dangerous men  most of them murderers  but by god if you don  t love them too . i  ve laughed at their wisecracks  been torn when they  ve made err in judgement  and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal .  br    br   the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show  s subtext  people aren  t always as they seem  and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds .  br    br   if you haven  t already  you most definitely should .  \n",
      "take a pinch of goodfellas  mix it with the godfather  add some roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy  and you have the sopranos  about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey . it  s almost as entertaining as pro wrestling . i am not the biggest fan of this show  but i do admire james gandolfini  s very complicated tony soprano  a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience . i also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel  voiced dom chianese as the bewildered but murderous uncle junior  silver  haired tony sirico as the perpetually perplexed paulie and the very beautiful edie falco as the duplicitous  tough  as  nails carmela soprano . the violence is sudden and graphic  the body count steadily climbs each season  but it is often the small moments that matter most here . watch paulie and tony  s nephew christopher  michael imperioli late of law  order  as they get lost in the pine barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck  both convinced they  ve had it .  \n",
      "i  ve only watched the first series on dvd  but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino  like script . the series is as good as goodfellas and casino  and almost as good as the godfather  hence not a       and far better than any of guy ritchie  s efforts . although there  s plenty of action  some of it pretty bloody  the story is character driven . even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines e . g . the priest  s relationship  or lack of  with carmilla and the restaurateur  s wife  and christopher and his dimwit friend  who didn  t last very long  a darwin award nominee     br    br   apart from the plot  the script and the acting  the other reasons i liked it  br    br    . it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce .  . the music .  . it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems .  \n",
      "it probably isn  t fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten  but oh well . . . . . . .  br    br   from a standpoint of acting  how could any actor fail with these characters  each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life . tony soprano  while a mob  capo  and suffering from mental illness  still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive . each of his men  you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism . it definitely brings out a sort  nosey  side in each and every viewer  and i include myself in this   br    br   while some above don  t care for bracco  i have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since good fellas . she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason  that makes him decent  that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long  if ever . she is simply put  his savior .  not speaking in religious tones   br    br   but the knockout performance here is without doubt  edie falco . to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series   oz  and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress . she has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress  something only actresses like merle streep can get away with . a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles . but as i have mentioned before  with a characters a strong as these  how can any actor fail   br    br   livia  s strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself . she is a survivor  as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors . she is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband  s business  yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey . she is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then tony himself .  br    br   all in all  the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january     to see the next season . this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series . it was what brought the larry sanders show  sex and the city  dream on  and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them . too much space in between seasons and very sporadic . until then  i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled .  \n",
      "i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it . i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released . in all   episodes so far  the best one is definitely episode    denial  anger  acceptance . this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos . his name was brendan filone . he was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver . brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang . in the end  he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath  and that  s my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos . brendan filone is   for me . and my   most favorite character ever was matthew bevilaqua  who was killed after attempting to murder christopher moltisanti . tony and pussy shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him . my   most favorite character is sean gismonte  who was killed right after shooting christopher . and finally  my   most favorite character is chucky signore  one of uncle junior  s henchmen . he was killed on a boat by tony . all the awesome characters are dead . that  s the only bad thing about the sopranos . all the cool guys always get killed . you know what would be great to change about the sopranos  they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris  tony  uncle junior  silvio  and paulie  because they need to get their revenge . brendan filone shall strike back            \n",
      "  the godfather    citizen kane    star wars    goodfellas  none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of  the sopranos  . each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity  completely and utterly three dimensional . we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly  despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs . evil  he is evil . soprano is the most provocative  intricate  and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history . if you  re in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer  and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment  watch  the sopranos  . i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season   and not want to continue with the series . each season is completely brilliant in its own way . dvds are essential to anybody  s collection  of out   \n",
      "not only do the storylines in  the sopranos  engage audiences from all over  but i think  for me at least  what brings the viewers back is the acting .  not even you  gary  can dispute that claim  james gandolfini  who plays the lead  man  tony soprano  has become  in this viewer  s opinion  one of the  hollywood elites  as far as acting in a television series goes . i wouldn  t go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino  or at least  not just yet . he  however  does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano . in the years since      gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor  mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos  that today he is considered to be among the best in the business . and it  s not just him .  the sopranos  fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco  edie falco  michael imperioli  dominic chianese  and the late nancy marchand who played tony  s dreadful mother . at this point in the show  s existence  it  s being considered a cult  classic and rightfully so . the first two seasons were extraordinary . violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner  but without a doubt  extraordinarily done . the third season was great  but didn  t quite live up to the hype of seasons  and  . season   which wrapped up right before new  years  was the weakest season yet  or at least  in my opinion it was  . despite a dry  spell  i still found it  season  of  the sopranos   to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that  s saying a lot because lately i  ve been noticing a trend in good new television shows . examples of this six feet under  the shield  curb your enthusiasm  and oz  which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year  . to get back to my point though  to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year  no less  is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers .  the sopranos  ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit . to close  i  d like to say   the sopranos  is the real deal folks . for the average mature viewer    and above  who enjoys drama and doesn  t mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity  you might want to check out  the sopranos  if you get the chance . trust me in that it will be well worth the time .  \n",
      "the  gangster  genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody . in retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichs that have been utilized in it  s genre  thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it . the sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it  s content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance  humor and unvarnished violence . the key protagonist tony soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew  however  tony is of two persona  s one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent . with out any inhibitions or contradictions i still adamantly believe that the sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory . all things considered i could make an elaborate statement on the series  but i won  t . if ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital  ambiguous  unrelenting  epic  uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you .  \n",
      "there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly  one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building . each character unfolds more and more each series . also each series has an array of different  small time characters  as well as the main . a good example of a character  who was only in three episodes  who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick . every little detail builds the perfect tv series . the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano  james gandolfini  who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two . the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable . whilst tony runs things with capos paulie  tony sirico  and silvio  steve van zant  his nephew christopher  michael imperioli  looks for a promotion . every episode also features tony  s other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano  edie falco  . on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano  dominic chianese  is trying to get what he can out of tony  s businesses despite being under house arrest . all the acting is powerful and characters complex  but the two who stand out the most are james gandolfini who  is  tony soprano . also michael imperioli who plays christopher  representing the younger        generation in crime . if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed  such as the wire and dexter . so the sopranos is definitely the godfather  goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv  \n",

      "i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine . what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in      it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x . of course  at that time x meant maturity . since i was only two years old at the time of the movie  s release  it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then . however  when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film  which included prostitution  the title itself was slang for a male prostitute   homosexuality loneliness physical  and to some extent emotional as well  abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day  i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release . it is worth noting that in the      s  midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r  some of the scenes could almost be rated pg    by today  s standards .  br    br   i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie . jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women . he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women . after being rejected by all the women he has come across  he meets a sleazy con  man named enrico  ratso  rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman . ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager . once again  joe is conned and before long is homeless . however  joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment . without giving away much more of the plot  i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams . i . e . joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health .  br    br   i want to make some comments about the movie itself . first of all  the acting is excellent  especially the leads . although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end  there are some classic scenes . in fact  there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny  i find them amusing . for example  there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over . dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says  hey  i  m walkin  here  i  m walkin  here   i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry . another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso  dustin hoffman  sends joe  jon voight  to a guy named o  daniel . what is amusing is that at first  we think o  daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o  daniel is nothing but a religious nut . in addition to the two scenes i mentioned  i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self  defense  john wayne  you gonna tell me he  s a fag   what i like is the delivery in that scene .  br    br   i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late     s  much of it rings true today . that  s because although the area around   nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years  homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was   years ago . also  many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character . one thing that impresses me about jon voight  s character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie  he had matured a great deal and that ratso  dustin hoffman  s character  was a good influence on him .  br    br   in conclusion  i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie  one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on . for example  there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings . also  what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck  jon voight  s character  and the people who were in his life in texas . even the ending  while i don  t want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie  is rather open  ended .  \n",
      "first i would like to say how great this . it is astounding and sometimes shocking . and to say the least i  m   years old and this is my favorite movie  i can definitely stand a boring film  but this is anything but boring . it is like a trip through humanity . its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece . it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers  voight and hoffman  who build a mutual friendship . joe buck  voight  a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women . soon he meets rico  ratso  rizzo  hoffman   who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent . ratso becomes joe  s  manager  but soon both men can  t find joe a job which results in stealing food . as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is . they can  t get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party . joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratso  s dream spot  florida . the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film . from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life .  \n",
      "i didn  t at all think of it this way  but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title  midnight cowboy  was a gay porno . at that point  all i had known of it was the reference made to it in that  seinfeld  episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and kramer  s all sick and with a nosebleed .  br    br   the movie was great  and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies i can  t even remember because they  re all crap .  br    br   the plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy joe buck going to new york trying to be a hustler  a male prostitute  basically   thinking it  ll be easy pickings  only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling him  charging him for their sexual encounter .  br    br   then he meets enrico salvatore rizzo  called  ratso  by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time . you think of him as a scoundrel  but a lovable one  like han solo or lando calrissian  and surprisingly he and joe become friends  and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such . rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad  pitiable man who  s very sick  and very depressed and self  conscious  hates being called  ratso  and wants to go to florida  where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved  and he  ll learn to be a cook and be famous there .  br    br   it  s heartwarming watching joe do all that he does to get them both down to florida  along with many hilarious moments  like ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party  and getting caught by the woman who says  gee  well  you know  it  s free . you don  t have to steal it .  and he says  well if it  s free then i ain  t stealin  it   and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi  and screams  hey  i  m walkin  here  i  m walkin  here     and the acting is so believable  you  d never believe joe buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor jon voight  and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman . it  s not the first time they  ve worked together in lead roles  but the chemistry is so thick and intense .  br    br   then there  s the sad part that i believe is quite an overstatement to call it  depressing  . ratso rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie  can barely walk  barely eat  coughs a lot  is sick  and reaches a head  point on the bus on its way to florida . he  s hurting badly  and only miles away from miami  he finally dies on the bus . the bus driver reassures everyone that nothing  s wrong  and continues on . sad  but not in the kind of way that  d make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you  ve just lost your dog of   years .  br    br   all in all  great movie . and the soundtrack pretty much consists just of  everybody  s talking   played all throughout the movie at appropriate times . an odd move  but a great one  as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly . go see it  it  s great  go buy it  \n",
      "this is a great example of a good  dumb movie . no  it is not high art by any means . nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks . but so what  the killer tomatoes series  four movies and a cartoon series  are basically good  natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks .  br    br   as the title suggests  this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france . in this case  professor gangrene  john astin  s  rd time in the role  has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france . steve lundquist returns as igor  a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long  lost true king of france . obviously he also plays the aforementioned l  l t k of f  happily skewering the french language .  br    br   opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato  like the others  ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon  and his human allies . mark price  recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series  plays a thinly disguised version of himself  passing himself as  michael j fox  as a way to win the girl of his dreams . and angela visser is a dream as marie  gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis . oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career  another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell  now best known as the hapless title subject of  who wants to marry a millionaire    . like co  creator john de bello  rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series .  br    br   what can you say about jon de bello  not much  really  except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and  having done that  has apparently dropped into obscurity . john  if you ever see this  thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes .  br    br   the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie . like return of the killer tomatoes  the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew . and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox . this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send  off to the series . okay  the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series  which was also quite clever   but cartoons just aren  t the same .  \n",
      "jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy  but hoffman  s performance  though reminiscent of his later turn in rainman  is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies . as a portrayal of a new york character  only daniel day lewis  portrayal of bill butcher in gangs of new york comes to mind as comparable  and day doesn  t give his character the emotional depth that hoffman gives ratso .  br    br   it  s typical of hoffman  s way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight . i think hoffman is one of the  or  best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels .  br    br   voight  s buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether  except that ratso pulls him down  pulls him down  but also teaches him  a lot about how to survive and  more importantly  how to live .  br    br   midnight cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself . i think that  as gritty a movie as it is  it has a very beautiful message  that no matter how much a loser you might be  ratso clearly defines  loser    if you can find a way to be true to yourself  you are in possession of the secret of life  and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else .  br    br   i can  t help but compare midnight cowboy to klute  from a few years later  which i think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape .  \n",
      "i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in     . after actually seeing it  however  i  m not surprised anymore . it was way ahead of its time in regards to its style  cinematography  and use of flashback to help develop joe buck  s character .  br    br   the most amazing thing to me is the depth of joe buck  s character in such a short movie . i think voight captured the naivete and the viciousness  when  provoked . the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him . i think when he looks in the mirror he  s trying to see if it  s really him that has done  or is about to do  something terrible .  br    br   i think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role . otherwise he may have been typecast after the graduate . anyway  this considered an all  time great for a reason .  \n",
      "jon voight plays a man named joe . joe is shook up by a haunting childhood . he has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism . he quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people . he meets a misfit named ratso  dustin hoffman  and the two for a relationship . they go out and work together in helping each other out . they become thieves . the two grow remarkably close and soon can  t live without each other . however  there is something very important that ratso hasn  t told joe  and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together . this is one of the greatest films ever made . it is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other . their story is devastating to watch  but is ultimately important for people to see . it  s one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street . the difference is that this film is from their perspective . their lives are shown to us and it  s devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt  especially if we at one time were one of those people . however  the film doesn  t try to guilt trip you . instead  it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling . it is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many hollywood films portray it such as milk money and pretty woman . the lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty  gritty  and ugly life and it  s sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of joe in this film does . what startles me the most about this film was that it came out in      and it has stood the test of time perfectly . today  s audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in     . the film was rated x  but what i notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest  realistic  and effective way . anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous  awkward  and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn  t shy away from any of that . the sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be . movies that were x rated such as midnight cowboy  a clockwork orange  greetings  last tango in paris  and fritz the cat all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an r rating today . the sex scenes in midnight cowboy will seem quite strong but they certainly aren  t sexy . they are not graphic  but they are realistic  and that  s what people should keep in mind when they view this film . the course language that is used in the film  particularly the word  fag  is used effectively and is not gratuitous . the violence is very shocking to watch even today  but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler . i  m really glad to see that midnight cowboy is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in      if not more . i can  t recommend this classic enough and i do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten .  br    br   pros  br    br    jon voight and dustin hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch . they have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual . you  ll forget who is playing them within minutes   br    br    beautiful score  br    br    not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today  br    br    fantastic and fast editing job  br    br   cons  br    br    for mature audiences only  br    br    the opening scenes are well done  but they could be just a little stronger .  \n",
      "although i love this movie  i can barely watch it  it is so real . so  i put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers . i remembered it vividly  but just wanted to see if i could find something i hadn  t seen before . . . . . . . . i didn  t that  s because it  s so real to me .  br    br   another  user  wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary . i  m all for that  it  s absolutely obvious that most of these people who  ve made comments about  midnight cowboy  may not have been born when it was released . they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in  at a later time . i  ll be just as ruinously frank i am    years  old . if you  re familiar with some of my other comments  you  ll be aware that i was a professional female  impersonator for   of those years  and also have appeared in film  you  d never recognize me  even if you were familiar with my night  club persona . do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film  you bet i do   . . . .  br    br   . . . . and am not the least bit ashamed . if you haven  t run  into some of them  it  s your loss  but  there  s a huge chance you have  but just didn  t know it . so many moms  dads  sons and daughters could surprise you . it should be no secret many actors  actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of  midnight cowboy  . who is to judge  i can name several  current big  time stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities  and weren  t the least bit damaged by their time spent there . i make no judgment  because these are humans  just as we all are  love  courage  kindness  compassion  intelligence  humility you name the attributes  they are all there  no matter what the package looks like .  br    br   the  trivia  about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of  ratzo  is a gem  he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles  how do you think he gets his input  i can also name lots of male  stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money . although the nightclub i last worked in for   years was world  famous and legit  i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our back  street  looking to make a pick  up .  br    br   this should be no surprise today  although it  s definitely action in hollywood and other cities  large and small . wake  up and smell the roses . they smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue .  br    br   some of the  users  thought  joe buck  had been molested by his grandma . although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend  i didn  t find any incidence of that . believe  it  or  not  kids haven  t always had their own rooms  because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going  on in the master  bedroom . whose business  hoffman may have begged for change on the streets  but some of the  users  point  out that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of  midnight cowboy   his actual salary would surprise you . i think he was robbed  no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role  nor that it made him a star for such great work as  deliverance  . he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie . the end of the   s may have been one of the first films to be so open  but society has always been hip .  br    br   i also did not find any homosexuality between  ratzo  and  joe   they were clearly opposites  unappealing to one another . they found a much purely higher relationship  true friendship . if you didn  t understand that at the end of the movie  then you  ve wasted your time .  joe  s  bewilderment  but unashamed devotion was apparent . yes  voight deserved an oscar for this role  one that john wayne could never pull  off  and he was as handsome in his youth .  br    br   hoffman is hoffman  you expect fireworks . he gave them superbly . wayne got his oscar . every character in this film was beautifully defined  if you don  t think they are still around  you are mistaken .  the party    attend some of the  raves  younger people attend . . . . . if you can get in . look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs  you  ll see every outrageous personality .  br    br   brenda viccaro was the epitome of society  s sleek women who have to get down to the nitty  gritty at times . if you were shocked by her brilliant acting  thinking  this isn  t real   look at today  s  ladies  who live on the brink of disrepute . . . . and are admired for it .  br    br   the brutality  joe  displayed in robbing the old guy  unfortunately  is also a part of life . you don  t have to condone it  but it  s not too much different than any violence .  joe  pointedly named his purpose  in that situation  i  d have handed  over the money quicker than he asked for it . that  s one of the scenes that makes this movie a break  through  one which i do not watch . i get heartbroken for both . . . . .  br    br   john schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye  opener  waldo salt didn  t write from clairvoyance . anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history  and should be proud for the honesty of it . perhaps  only in america  can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations  while other movie  makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public . not looking doesn  t mean it isn  t there  give me the truth every time . bravo  to all . . . . . .  \n",
      "acidic  unremitting  and beautiful  john schlesinger  s masterpiece is no less effective today than   years ago  when american life was even more disorienting . the film probably could not have been made at any other time in history  because so many upheavals were taking place in the late     s final dissolution of the great american west  the intensification of war in vietnam  and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety .  br    br    midnight cowboy  is widely known as the only academy award  winning film to garner an  x  rating  but there is much more behind its fame it also exceeds the norm as a work of art . while this film  from the novel by james leo herlihy  has much to say about the erosion of american life  it transcends    s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras . the two main characters  in fact  are standard antiheroes  men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world .  br    br   the initial focus of  midnight cowboy  is on    year  old joe buck  a physically imposing texas native played by jon voight . in the opening scenes  we follow joe  s bus trip to new york city  where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents  the ability to pleasure women  and earn his fortune as a hustler . we learn upon his arrival that joe is laughably nave in the sex trade . garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as  one hell of a stud   the young texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with enrico  ratso  rizzo  dustin hoffman   a sickly con man and petty thief from the bronx . ratso  who is short  thin  and with a limp  proves of little monetary help to joe . they quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months  joe and ratso shiver in a condemned manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names . it is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them  the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds .  br    br   throughout the film  joe hearkens back to earlier years in texas  including life with his grandmother sally  ruth white   who served as guardian his harried relationship with  crazy  annie  jennifer salt   a notorious local girl and a traumatic event in which joe and annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair . very much of its time   midnight cowboy  strings together a wild array of flashbacks  dream sequences  and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds . for every moment of understanding we gain from joe and ratso  more questions about their lives are generated . both men are no doubt in tatters they have no clear sense of direction until ratso falls into the throes of illness and joe finally senses a purpose for being alive . this revelation pushes  midnight cowboy  to its conclusion  a rather hopeful one in a very grim story .  br    br   while joe and ratso badly need some luck  the direction of john schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of waldo salt  s screenplay in allowing voight and hoffman to thrive . their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast  which features sylvia miles  brenda vaccaro  and members of the andy warhol clique  offers itself as an essential part of the storyline . the flashback sequences involving voight  ruth white  and jennifer salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost .  br    br   any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film  thanks to the excellent cinematography of adam holender   the boy who could fly    smoke   and editing by hugh robertson   shaft   . the visuals of  midnight cowboy  work with its soundtrack  assembled by john barry  as a cohesive unit  sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades . the lead song everybody  s talking is sung by nilsson  which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase . the memorable harmonica theme is played by jean  toots  thielemans .  br    br    midnight cowboy  has been released in a two  disc collector  s edition by mgm  ua  which contains expanded features and commentary . also available is a     dvd release  used for this review   which offers dual widescreen and standard format with  .  dolby digital sound enhancement three  language subtitles and closed captioning french  dubbing   a theatrical re  release trailer  not the  original  as advertised   and an eight  page production booklet . both dvd editions contain a   th anniversary restored version of the film  showing its original brilliance . well  deserving of its three oscars  best picture  schlesinger  waldo salt  and additional nominations  voight  hoffman  sylvia miles  hugh robertson    midnight cowboy  will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics .  br    br     out of   \n",
      "what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both . there really aren  t many glimpses of hope in this film for either character  but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other .  br    br   this film features jon voight  s finest performance and probably dustin hoffman  s as well . the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns  though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors  including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film . also  for those interested  andy warhol  s apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene .  br    br   if you haven  t seen this movie  it is essential . check it out .  \n",
      "  midnight cowboy  is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason  it really is one of the finest films ever made in america . its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial . no wonder it was a huge success when initially released . but be warned  its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made . the characters are memorable  well  developed  and ultimately tragic . the filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the hollywood ending  something which was basically mandatory by the   s . still  this is why i treasure the years of     to     for american film . its a time when well  made  innovative  and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer . all this was over by the time  star wars  was released .  br    br   the direction by john schlesinger makes the material work . it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing . unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects   midnight cowboy  has aged quite well . its still as powerful now as it was when initially released . the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece . the characters  backgrounds are never fully explained  but the performances make them completely developed . both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic  despite their sometimes reprehensible actions  . plus  being a fan of vintage exploitation films  i loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy   nd street .  midnight cowboy  is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made .         \n",
      "midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in      drawing an x rating . by today  s standards  it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating . jon voight  who has been better  is competent in his role as joe buck  an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city . he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo  who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes . the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic . as ratso  dustin hoffman simply shines . hoffman has often been brilliant  but never more so than in this portrayal . he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison . losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences . director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production  but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer . worth seeing for hoffman  s performance alone .  \n",
      "midnight cowboy is not for everybody . it  s raw  painful  and realistic but very entertaining . the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances . voight as the texas hustler  joe buck  who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler . he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy . the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women . sadly  buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas . he was raised by his grandmother  sally buck  played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in     from cancer . the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and buck  s characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship . the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job . as the film evolves  buck  s past comes to the surface and it  s haunting but not clear . the film is not for children but compared to today  s films and television programming  midnight cowboy might be more tame . i can  t forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you can  t forget . it  s also a tearjerker of a film  so get your hankies out too .  \n",

      "john schlesinger  s  midnight cowboy  is perhaps most notable for being the only x  rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture . this was certainly how i first came to hear of it  and  to be completely honest  i didn  t really expect much of the film . this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible  but somehow i didn  t consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching . this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting  ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack   everybody  s talking  at me  i don  t hear a word they  re sayin    make this film one of the finest explorations of life  naivety and friendship ever released .  br    br   young joe buck  then  newcomer jon voight   dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy  travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler  a male prostitute . women  however  do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services  and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up . during these exploits  joe comes to meet enrico  ratso  rizzo  dustin hoffman   a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money . when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament  ratso offers joe a place to stay  and  working together  they attempt to make  largely dishonest  lives for themselves in the cold  gritty metropolis of new york .  br    br   joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex however  his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman  sylvia miles  twenty dollars . though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent  ratso is just as nave as joe . ratso  with his painful limp and hacking cough  is always assuring himself that  if only he could travel to the warmth of miami  somehow everything would be all right . this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbeck  s classic novel   of mice and men .   br    br   shot largely on the streets of new york   midnight cowboy  is a grittily  realistic look at life in the slums . watching the film  we can almost feel ourselves inside ratso  s squalid  unheated residence  our joints stiff from the aching winter cold . the acting certainly contributes to this ultra  realism  with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society . hoffman  in particular  is exceptional in his role  i  m walkin  here  i  m walkin  here     managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much  lauded debut in      s  the graduate .  both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars  also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was sylvia miles  for an appearance that can  t have been for more than five minutes   though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in  true grit .   midnight cowboy  eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations  including best picture  best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo salt .  br    br    midnight cowboy  is told mainly in a linear fashion  though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joe  s past . rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about  the audience is invited to think about it for themselves  and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing . the achingly  beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope  but a large amount of uncertainty . gritty  thought  provoking and intensely fascinating   midnight cowboy  is one for the ages .  \n",
      "  midnight cowboy  was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic . you know it  s a classic the moment its insistent theme song   everybody  s talking  starts up on the soundtrack   actually not written for the film   and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck   naked and in the shower  . we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he  s  one helluva stud  who  s to doubt him  this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else  his performance here would still be legendary . as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish  anaconda  is a source of pleasure  .  br    br   the film became famous and infamous almost overnight . it was a crowd  pleaser   even with its downbeat ending   funny and sexy and recognizably  real    it was the tail  end of the sixties and all the characters rang true  . it was also the first  x  rated film to win the oscar as the year  s best picture . adapted   brilliantly   by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first main  stream commercial american movie to deal with  taboo  subjects such as homosexuality and drug  taking in a matter  of  fact manner . everyone is recognizably human  warts and all  and everyone is treated sympathetically . voight  s joe buck is an innocent abroad  a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler   a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy he  s a cross between a gigolo and a social worker  . but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy  wormy little con  man called  ratso  rizzo   dustin hoffman  fresh from  the graduate  and he  s a revelation   he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe  dream .  br    br   essentially it  s a male love story   though totally platonic   between these two not so unlikely bedfellows . both totally alone  both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other   voight with his physical prowess  hoffman with his street  wise savvy  . they are misfits adrift from the mainstream  tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others . though  straight  voight isn  t beyond a homosexual encounter in a   nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself .  the whole film posits a strangely  christian  attitude  .  br    br   it  s also magnificently acted . while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver  bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangers  on  beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesinger  s direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien  s totally detached eye  view of the american under  belly without rancor and without criticism . on second thoughts  maybe it is a great movie after all .  \n",

      "midnight cowboy opens with a run down drive in theater with the voice  over of the main character joe buck  jon voight  singing in the shower . he is singing a cowboy song  the very thing he strives to be . joe picks up his humdrum life living in texas and moves it to new york city with the dream of lots of women  and even more money . he dresses as the epitome of the cowboy  but in a cartoonish fashion  not even his friends take him seriously . he begins his journey on the bus to nyc and we can quickly see how diluted joe is through his interactions with the other passengers . this is primarily a story of joe  s realization of the harsh realities of the real world .  br    br   he starts off as a very nave southerner thinking he can make it in nyc just on his good looks . he has no other reason to think otherwise  as they proved helpful in the past we learn this from the many flashbacks he has . in the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical . they are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance  as they are  they are coming out of his past . however  as joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of nyc we see more of his past  which is no longer whimsical but gritty  filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events . this is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted  and her being raped . in one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick . this mirrors the way in which joe himself is falling apart the naivet that he once carried is falling off of him . he and ratso  dustin hoffman  are living in squalor  and barely able to get food to eat joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks  that there is a gritty underbelly of new york that he didn  t envision . his subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out .  br    br   ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to joe  but in an opposite way ratso is joe  s foil . joe is a handsome  strong man who  for the most part  has a good outward appearance . ratso  on the other hand  from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite . he is short  dark  and always coated with a sheen of sweat . he understands how the world works  that it is unforgiving  and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail just as his father did . they are living in the same world  the same apartment even  but they understand things on a completely different level .  br    br   the theme of alienation  one that is common of this era  is very apparent in this film . neither joe nor ratso fit into the culture surrounding them . joe feels trapped in texas and moves to nyc where he is still very much an outsider . ratso  living in the cold of nyc  wishes to move to sunny florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life . even though this is his ideal  in the fantasy we get from ratso  s perspective  it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society . in said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him  he is yet again an outsider  alienated from society .  br    br   it is not until the end that the gap between joe and ratso begins to narrow . joe resorts to violence he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for florida for himself and ratso . on the journey we see joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film . he is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to florida for vacation . he dresses ratso the same way he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering  but it is to no avail . upon ratso  s death on the bus  their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders . even in this new culture they have entered  they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film . despite the ratso  s death  and joe  s continued alienation  the film ends with the hope that joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in nyc . midnight cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society  and alienation  with stellar performances by both voight and hoffman .  \n",

      "i sat down to watch  midnight cowboy  thinking it would be another overrated    s     s movie . some of my favorite films come from the    s  in the same vein as  midnight cowboy    taxi driver    mean streets    panic in needle park   etc .  but there are many  many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking  unfortunately a vast majority of them don  t hold up as well today . i sort of feel this way about  easy rider .   although it  too  is one of my favorites .   br    br   so  i didn  t expect much from  midnight cowboy  but got a lot back . it  s a touching story  well  made and well  told with some of the best performances of all time . dustin hoffman  as enrico  ratso  rizzo  gives one of his best  it  s a bit funny at times  he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks  maybe because of the lenny   simpsons  connection   but hoffman is entirely convincing . half of the film  s budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in hollywood . opposite him is the second  billed jon voight as joe buck  the  cowboy  who travels north to the big apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute . soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named  ratso   who offers to become joe  s  manager  for a certain percentage of profits .  br    br   the movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long . some films can tend to drag  especially some of the films that were made in the    s because  as it  s been said in  easy riders  raging bulls   the directors were the stars of the movies in the     s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material  going on too long examining characters  scenes  etc . that aren  t important . just about the only scene i felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party  it makes the film seem extremely outdated  similar to the drug odysseys in  easy rider   and really harms its flow because it  s not needed .  br    br   other than that   midnight cowboy  is an almost flawless motion picture . i was pleasantly surprised . it does have its flaws  flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been  for instance  and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy  such as the gay movie theater sequence  but if you can handle its content  midnight cowboy  is a truly great motion picture  an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late    s  early    s . it  s a depressing movie  yes  and by today  s standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of  life is horrible  etc .  . . . but i still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long  long time .  br    br   highly recommended . one of the best films of the    s .  it was technically released in late     but i  d still categorize it as a     s film . it also won the best picture oscar  being the first  and only  x  rated motion picture to do so . it was later re  rated r on appeal .   br    br    .     \n",
      "the only reason i knew of midnight cowboy was because it was in the afi critic  s top    . for a top    it is not a very well known movie indeed  i had to look hard to find a copy  i got the dvd version for about half  price . surprisingly it was only rated m     the uncut version  .  br    br   i doubt many will take notice of this review  more like comment  so i  ll make it brief .  br    br   this is perhaps one of the strangest movies i  ve seen  partly because of the use of montages  artistic filming  very art  house  and the unusual theme . there are many things in the film i still don  t understand  i  ve seen it twice   and it makes for an emotionally confusing film .  br    br   the filming and acting were very good  and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable . the main character is joe buck  a  cowboy  from texas who moves to new york to become a male prostitute . he meets the crippled conman enrico  ratso  rizzo and  of course they become friends going through the usual escapades . what makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different .  br    br   i felt the film didn  t really develop the relationship between buck and enrico rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection  although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic . you probably already know what happens by reading the reviews  but its pretty obvious from the start .  br    br   i personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes . the deprivation of humanity  shown by the darkness of the city streets  the breaking  down tenements  . most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law  a conman  giggolo . etc  yet you can  t help liking them . joe buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic  while we begin to feel pity for ratso later in the film .  br    br   i think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground  breaking for its period . at the time  and even now  it was definitely not a typical movie  quite art  house  . at a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns  musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as midnight cowboy pops up .  br    br   on a personal level  i must say i quite liked the film . the imagery conveyed a dream  like quality . i particularly liked the scene at the party  the music  images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching . however  as a movie for entertainment  s sake it was a bit lacking  not really my style of movie  in thrills . this is a film to be savoured and appreciated  rather than a cheap thrills action flick .  br    br   although i would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film  the characters and their motives were quite interesting . from what i understand from the flashbacks  joe buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother  although it still doesn  t seem to be relevant to the story . he is a happy  go  lucky young stud  who suppresses his darker memories . the religious connotations in the film are also puzzling . some have suggested a homosexual connection between buck and ratso  although i fail to see where they have got the idea from . the theme of homo  sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation  and later in joe buck  s encounter with a lonely old man  but it has little to do with the main story .  br    br   certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade  it has more of a   s feel to it than a   s feel  and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do . while it has a simple  sentimental story to it  disguised by a hard edge  the beauty of the film is in the strange  often psychedelic sequences .  \n",

      "horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn  t always win out over imagination . we all know that killers like freddy  jason  michael and even leatherface shouldn  t be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day . most of us don  t believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains . and let  s hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them . this is where imagination wins out over fact . horror  and most films in general  requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow . this usually isn  t a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c . scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville . but what i do have a problem digesting  without wanting to regurgitate  is when a film has a killer like the one in this film . to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself  but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed . there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is . but the   minutes prior to this point is a well done  suspenseful  blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough . if the film would have offered me a different killer  then i would actually be raving about it . this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film  but believe me  anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me .  br    br   john cassevetes plays dr . sam cordell . he and his daughter jenny  played beautifully by erin flannery  have just recently moved to this small new england town . cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died . we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman  one can only presume it is his wife  is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour . her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed . again  i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway . cassevetes  it has to be mentioned  is strange to say the least . cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental . there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities . it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent  but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug . thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy .  br    br   casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan . he has a deceptive smile and a virile  commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice . but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene . he just has that slimy  disingenuous  phlegmatic  uneasy way about him . he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film . i guess that is a credit to the writers  the director and to cassevetes himself . there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get  go .  br    br   the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry . there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see  something or someone is watching them . when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck  the young woman wanders into the shed  just to play a prank . once she is there  she is attacked . the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail . hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in . he looks frantically scours the room and spots his would  be lover bleeding in the corner  and then smacko  the guy gets it . it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note .  br    br   also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces . tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place  he has another dream . toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother  a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galen .  br    br   throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time  the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped . this is my first feeble  and careful  attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement . it just didn  t strike the right chord .  br    br   the incubus is a well done film . it is tense  tight and even most of the performances are very well done . i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders . but when you get through all that was good in the film  you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth . and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones .  br    br    out of     this could have been a nine . too bad .

      "culled from the real life exploits of chuck connors and steve brodie in     s new york   the bowery  is high energy and good natured .  br    br   but be warned casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of wallace beery and little jackie cooper . the very first shot might be startling . this is true to the time it was set and the time it was made . and it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods . it certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere .  br    br   beery as connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action  a loud  mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade . and he has a soft spot for ornery orphan cooper . raft as brodie is connors  slicker  better looking rival in almost every endeavor . brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention  leading up to a jump off the brooklyn bridge  it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy  .  br    br   beery is as bombastic as ever with a put  on irish  american accent . he is just the gruff sort of character to draw children  cats and ladies in distress . this is possibly the most boisterous character raft ever played  and he even gets to throw in a little dancing  as well as a show of leg  . and again he mistakes the leading lady  lovely fay wray  for a prostitute . cooper is as tough as either of them  though he gets a chance to turn on the tears .  br    br   the highlight isn  t the jump off the bridge but a no  holds  barred fistfight between connors and brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals . it  s sure someone bruised more than an ego .  \n",
      "when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores jud . this is not steven kings best work . i thought that his best work was the shining . i don  t think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking . as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick . i mean making the gage evil and how he kills jud is genius . making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool . people who didn  t like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all . don  t expect something from a movie that it isn  t . it still in a general area wasn  t that good . i still recommend people to watch the movie  \n",

      "there is something about pet sematary that i never felt anywhere else . maybe the fact i was a kid when i first watched it made this experience so memorable . but as i keep watching it over and over again  it never gets old  and i never get bored . from the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending  there is something insane  sad and scary at the same time  and it keeps ringing in your head sometimes dead is better   br    br   i don  t think it would be useful to relate the whole story again . all you need to know is it starts from point a  the most perfect situation for a happy american family  and step by step drowns to point b  which is  believe me  the very end of all joy  . the music is perfect  the story makes sense  the special effects are cool  and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be . like i said  sometimes dead is better   \n",
      "overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come . although the plot is not     accurate to the book most everything is correct . the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts . i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie  because i hadn  t found out about the movie yet  but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal  mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected . overall i give this movies a  out of   for its good parts  relative accuracy and overall making sense  and for its bad parts  large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies  .  \n",
      "personally  i absolutely love this movie and novel  i read the book first and decided to see the movie  . first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind . the acting is also great and i love the cast . judd crandall  plays fred gwynne  fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you . there are also a few corny lines thrown in there  idk if they were meant to be corny   but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh . the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie . not only will you love it but you  ll want to see it again and again  i recommend this     to any horror fan    \n",
      "ah  clichs  clichs  clichs they  re a main part of a wide variety of horror films . this one  has a lot of them . still  it  s stephen king  one of the best masters of horror . this movie was really good  just too predictable . and what horror movie doesn  t have stupid people  this one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken . pet semetary i found to be creepy a little . the way everything is set up was really spooky  but not terrifying . for the most part  the acting was somewhat believable  the suspense wasn  t that suspenseful  but the entertainment level is set at a major rank my eyes were practically glued to the screen . all stephen king fans must see this movie  but as for anyone else  expect an okay thriller .  \n",
      "probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet . not surprising  since king himself wrote the screenplay . the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house . one of the other residents is jud  a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area . one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard . the other is a path leading to the pet sematary  where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway . soon enough  ellie creed  s cat  church  is found dead . luckily  this happens while the family  with the exception of louis  the father   is away for thanksgiving . jud takes louis to another burial ground  beyond the pet sematary  where church is to be buried . later  louis is greeted  not so politely  by church . he  s returned  appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in . maybe he was buried alive . maybe not . nothing more i can say without ruining the story .  br    br   of all the king adaptions i  ve seen this would be the most terrifying . the characters are real and the situations are normal . mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings . suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film  due in part to the plot development . the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever . then  of course  we have the conclusion . easy to determine what  s going to happen  but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary  and sometimes disturbing  moments .  br    br   overall  this is a good film and an excellent adaption . if you enjoy being scared and don  t mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then  pet sematary  is just what you  re looking for . non horror fans will want to avoid this .  \n",
      "so often with stephen king adaptations  you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books . this really captures the heart of the book . maybe because they don  t use large chunks of text straight from the book  but it  s a bit more of an improv of the events in the story . a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage . dale midkiff and denise  tasha yar  crosby really act like his parents . there  s a scene where louis is cuddling gage  and they are very natural together . fred gwynne is wonderful . he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody  and is wise and warm just like jud should be .   out of     \n",
      "ok  first i have to point the fact that when i first saw this flick i was  years old . if i had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time  id probably have noted that this is just another cheaply  made  cable  tv horror film with some well  made scenes . but when youre nine you just dont care about those facts . this scared the hell out of me back then  especially those aforementioned zelda  scenes  and they still do  . nowadays im kind of hooked to this film . i have to see this maybe once in a month  and on every new years eve i watch this with a    pack of beer  bunch of friends . its like an appetizer for a good party  i kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense . midkiff and crosby do look like i wanted louis and rachel look like  but one cant see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two . hughes and gwynne pretty much save the scenes which  the creeds  underact . what i actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to pet sematary  and i dont mean the zombie stuff here . the atmosphere of this film is certainly a novelty and one of a kind . honestly  how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable  tv one  but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror  chillers out there  alright i busted some of the casts balls a minute ago  but i have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection . but hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to pet sematary  i really would love to know . . . and i dont mean night of the living dead here . . . this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff .  \n",

      "minor spoiler  br    br   underrated little stephen king shocker . it  s not perfect  by any stretch of the imagination   even if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better  there  d still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with . the old micmac burial ground  rachel  s terminally ill sister  and the jacob  marley  an victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent  and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed . but few horror movies really are perfect  and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock . pet sematary  may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory  with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda . it  s politically incorrect  it  s tasteless  it  s gratuitous   and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way safer  horror movies never can . add to that one of fred gwynne  s best performances and mary lambert  s witty direction  and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie   even with the hokey ending . highly recommended for genre fans .  .  out of   .  \n",

      "as this happens to be one of most favorite novels  i was very excited to see the move . i was not disappointed  yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on  but i think that the movie stuck true to the book  and was a really good movie . it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review  but this is one of the good ones . it is such a dark story  which i guess is why i like it . . and what is better than the dead coming to life . . and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too . if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book   it is a well written screen play  the actors could have done a better job  i only say this for rachel  and ellie . . she was so whinny  i liked everyone else a lot . . and most important to me . . it stuck true with the novel .  \n",
      "in the trivia section for pet sematary  it mentions that george romero  director of two stephen king stories  creepshow and the dark half  was set to direct and then pulled out . one wonders what he would  ve brought to the film  as the director mary lambert  while not really a bad director  doesn  t really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of king  s novel  of which he wrote the screenplay . there are of course some very effective  grotesquely surreal scenes  mainly involving the sister zelda  likely more of a creep  out for kids if they see the film   and the casting in some of the roles is dead  perfect . but something feels missing at times  some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably king  like atmosphere  which is in this case about as morbid as you  re going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in  who knows if he  ll save that for his final novel . . .   br    br   as mentioned though  some of the casting is terrific  notably miko hughes as gage creed  the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an    s horror movie  to being a little monster  i say that as a compliment  of course  especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel  . and there is also a juicy supporting role for fred gwynne of the munsters  who plays this old  secretive man with the right notes of under  playing and doom in tone . and applause goes to whomever did the make  up on andrew hubatsek . but there are some other flaws though in the other casting dale midkiff is good  not great  as the conflicted  disturbed father figure creed  and his daughter ellie is played by an actress that just didn  t work for me at all .  br    br   in terms of setting up some chilling set  pieces  only a couple really stand  out a certain plot  thickening moment  not to spoil  it does involve a cool ramones song   and the first visit to the pet sematary  the bigger one   including the sort of mystical overtones king had in the shining . for the most part it  s a very polished directing job  though it could  ve been made even darker to correspond with the script . if thought out in logical terms  albeit in king terms  it is really one of his more effective works of the period . but it doesn  t add up like it could  or should . still  it makes for a nifty little midnight movie .  \n",

      "hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film . the plot of the film  involving two boxers fighting over a girl  is straight  forward drama without much to recommend it . hitchcock  s talent  though  is found in his stunning use of images . nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols . especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer . he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know . the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point  of  view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was . the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women . the object of the boxers  desires is driven by money and lust  not reason or love . the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships . all in all  the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcock  s early work and his development as a visual storyteller .  \n",
      "i sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of hitchcock  s lesser known films  because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden hitchcock gem or a true hitchcock great or some other generic if  only  people  would  watch  this  they  would  see  that  this  is  a  great  hitchcock  film  just  as  much  as  vertigo  north  by  northwest  psycho  rear  window  etc . so  that being said  i would just like to say that if  only  people  would  watch  this  they  would  see  that  this  is  a  great  hitchcock  film  just  as  much  as  vertigo  north  by  northwest  psycho  rear  window  etc .  br    br   now  that may be overshooting a little bit  the ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above  but compared to the other films that hitchcock made in the late     s and early     s  i really think that the ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them . as an almost brand new director  there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career .  br    br   granted  the film does start with  among other things  the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer  and i use idiot in the definitive manner  the way stephen king so often does  having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people . i suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then  but i think it is one of the most off  putting sequences in any hitchcock film i  ve seen .  br    br   the main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round  but when he meets his match  it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife  s finger . so begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman  who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly .  br    br    spoilers  there is  for example  a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and  just before going into the building  she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss . this kiss is never explained  and there is also the fact that  even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband  or at least ultimately chooses him  they look into each other  s eyes but do not actually kiss .  br    br   the film is certainly beautifully photographed  even more so than several films that hitch released in subsequent years . there is also a performance by gordon harker as one round jack  s trainer who  in his stone faced expressionism  reminds me quite often of the brilliant buster keaton . hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous  but this is a great sample of his early work .  \n",
      "sandra bernhard  s without you i  m nothing  the movie released in      followed on the heels of her     off  broadway stage production . . . what she and others refer to in the movie as her  smash  hit one  woman show .   br    br   there were several changes in monologues and one  liners  and the movie version visually re  vamps the story  taking sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage performer in new york  during what she calls her  superstar summer   to an illusory  almost desperate existence back in her home in los angeles  her fictional manager in the film refers to it as getting sandra back  to her roots  to . . . upscale supper clubs like the parisian room .   br    br   there  s a point to be made here . sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of american pop culture to an audience that doesn  t completely see it . in l . a . she  s playing to a predominantly black audience  trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is  shashonna   a madonna  look  alike stripper . and even then  with shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from  like a virgin   there  s not much to be said for the audience  s enjoyment of the show . the scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone . a funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping shashonna out of her pants .  br    br   but  if she  s going down  sandra  s doing so with style and force  conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability . . . right to the point at which she  s naked  literally   pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom . her depictions of interactions with the likes of calvin klein  jerry lewis  bianca jagger  ralph lauren and  what we  re lead to believe is  warren beatty are fictional and hilarious .  br    br   sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment  performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of nina simone  s song  four women  while dressed in a mufti and other african garb  singing lines such as  my skin is black    my hair is wooly   and  they call me sweet thing .   br    br   she resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of the frenzied estate auction for andy warhol  leave it to andy to have the wisdom and sensitivity into the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the indian product . . . that they  ve been so lucky to cash in on this whole santa fe thing happening .   br    br   she expounds on the excessiveness of hollywood  consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him  saying  mister  if this is about ishtar  i  m getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that  s too self  indulgent even for me    br    br   sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism . dressed as a cosmo girl  sandra retells her young  girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss . she eventually concludes in relief   i  ll never be a statistic  not me . i  m under    and i  m going to be married    br    br   sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society  when he touches you in the night  does it feel all right  or does it feel real  i say it feels real . . . mighty real .   br    br   finally  she cries for change in progressive american society by channeling disco greats patrick cowley and sylvester and proclaiming   eventually everyone will funk    br    br   all this comes in the form of glitzy  schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by billy paul  burt bacharach  hank williams and laura nyro  to name a few . at the same time  the idealized  fictional incarnation of sandra   her self  generated mirror image   floats around town  a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the kabala  studying chemistry and listening to nwa rap music .  br    br   in without you i  m nothing  sandra bernhard explores emotions and existences that  up until then  she  d only toyed with as a regular guest on late night with david letterman . her almost child  like enthusiasm for shock  exhibited throughout the    s  is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure  and her confidence in the face of materialism and american celebrity proves refreshing . this approach to comedy would change sandra  s direction forever and mark the more mature  more personable entertainer to come .  br    br   if you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour  celebrity  sex  loneliness  despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship  this movie will keep you in stitches . it may not be meant to be funny across the board . perhaps it  s a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some . but consider the emptiness of the world sandra paints for you  and you  ll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is .  br    br   but see without you i  m nothing with a friend  in the know  because it  s definitely funnier that way . before you know it  the two of you will be trading sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone

      "this early film has its flaws   a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance   but it already clearly demonstrates hitchcock  s mastery of editing and the use of powerful images . it  s also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically note  for examples  the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery .  br    br   its core  though  remains the final match  which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing . even though you know that the hero has to win  it becomes quite believable that he will lose  and the movement of his wife from the champion  s corner to his  motivating the final plot pay  off  is very well entwined with the progress of the match . the inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should you can almost hear the ticking  even though this is a silent film  the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them  . the pacing becomes astonishingly rapid  and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it .  br    br   the only dvd release with which i am familiar is that of laserlight  a public domain company . as with each hitchcock silent they  ve released  they  ve attached various musical selections  mostly orchestral  to the action . the sound editing is frequently sloppy  and the sound quality varies widely  but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices  and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here .  br    br   this is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest . it deserves an honorable place in both the hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films .  \n",
      "surprisingly good early effort from alfred hitchcock . one of the only original screenplays written by hitchcock himself  this film shows remarkable story structure . it kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ  one round  jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter . the movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between jack  his girl and the professional boxer . the rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men  this time for the heavyweight crown . even in this early film  hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement . an armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness . the only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in     . the final match  as a result  ends up being somewhat anticlimactic . the story  though  is what carries this film through .  \n",
      "at first  i thought the ring would be a more than normal movie with it  s ordinary plot . how surprised was i  of course  the plot is simple  one girl is in love with two men  but hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter  with laughter and fear  with compassion and anguish . the way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair  the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men  the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest movies  north by northwest  the rope  etc .  . the master did it great even before his thirties   \n",
      "the ring was made from the only screenplay hitchcock wrote himself and it deals  as many of his earliest pictures do  with a love triangle . at first glance  it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity  themed morality comedies of cecil b . de mille  but more than that it is the first really competent hitchcock picture . even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers  he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense .  br    br   as well as being a student of the german expressionist style  the rhythmic editing style of sergei eisenstein had had its impact upon hitchcock . but here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery . this is apparent from the opening shots  where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo . and like eisenstein  the editing style seems to suggest sound  for example when a split  second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in  we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring .  br    br   there is also a contrast  particularly with silent films from the us  in that the ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards . as much as possible is conveyed by imagery  and hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip  read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters  speech . and it  s not done by contrived symbolism or overacting  it  s all done by getting the right angles and the right timing  particularly with point  of  view shots  as well as some strong yet subtle performances . there are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices  particularly double exposures   many of which were unnecessary  but there is far less of this than there is in the lodger .  br    br   let  s make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors . first up  the stunningly handsome and very talented carl brisson in the lead role . in spite of his talent i was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role  as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist  but that just goes to show how much i know  as it turns out brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting . playing his rival is the competent ian hunter  who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the   s . the most demanding role in the ring has to be that given to lillian hall  davis  torn between two lovers . she pulls it off very well however with an emotive  understated performance  and it  s a shame her career never lasted in the sound era . and last but not least the great gordon harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role .  br    br   the ring  s climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent  era hitchcock . martin scorcese may have had his eye on the ring when he directed the fight scenes in raging bull  as his watchword for these scenes was  stay inside the ring  . the fight in the ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots  but when the action intensifies hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it  with close  ups and point  of  view shots . hitchcock  s aim always seems to have been to involve his audience  and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the character  s fear or paranoia .  br    br   the ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known the lodger . it  s a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture  and probably the best of all his silent features .  \n",
      "the symbolic use of objects  form editing  the position of characters in the scene . . . these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had . the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses  the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger . . . while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards  in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken . even the title has a least four meanings that i can see the boxing ring  the wedding ring  the bracelet the lover buys  and the love triangle at the heart of the story .  \n",

      "i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst . the gorilla looks just terrific  and the eyes were especially lifelike . it  s even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top . rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine . usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw  man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla . it  s an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans  how they feel the same emotions we do  and yet how we really can  t treat them just like people because they aren  t . not many films venture into this territory and it  s worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human  animal similarity .  \n",

      "being an otaku since the days of robotech  i can still say that gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time . considering when it was made  the animation is of superior quality . there are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality . although the final episode is in black and white  it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film . although it has been described as being  sappy   it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do . since the main character is a female  it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to  macho  man  tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers . the seiryuu for noriko  incidentally  also plays akane in ranma    . noriko is as   dimensional a cartoon can get her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will . the only complaint i have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears . even the gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious  homing laser  and  buster shield   which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true dracula style  technique . i doubt that scene was meant to be funny  but it cracked me up . yet all in all  i would rank gunbuster in the top   anime of all time .  \n",
      "this anime is a must  see for fans of evangelion . it  s an earlier work of anno hideaki  but his unrestrained  dramatic style is quite in place . also  those who didn  t like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable . gunbuster is rather unique to sci  fi anime in that it  s actually based on real science . in fact  the show has several little  science lesson  interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie . one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light . the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed . the main character remains age   or   throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably . be warned  this show is heavy on the sap at times . it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen . i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo  hoo scenes  because the series is otherwise very good  but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one . on an interesting note  gainax  as always  managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes . however  they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway . the ending is a bit silly  but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldn  t help but love it . gunbuster is  in my opinion  one of the finest pieces of anime around .  \n",
      "   slight spoilers    br    br   way back  before evangelion was made  before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans  and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite  gunbuster was made . with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time  and the famous otakon shorts or course  gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up . it didn  t make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before  space opera .  br    br   luckily  gainax decided to put it out as a six  part oav  direct to video  series . this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film . this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long  with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way . besides that  they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam  and many other popular space operas .  br    br   for one  the shows starts out pretty light  with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting . noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle  when she was still a little kid . this makes her life at the academy quite hard  as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors . the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama  with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school . things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced  and noriko and kazumi  best girl in class  are chosen to help the assembled fleet out .  br    br   the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space  focusing on both personal drama and action . a couple more characters are introduced  and parts of noriko  s past are dragged up again . besides that  the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute  and the gunbuster  mankind  s final hope  is presented . smart as writer okada was  he incorporated the principles of time dilation  to spice things up a bit . in short  time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light . this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete . also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated  when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base  who have aged considerably more than her . the science might not be perfect  but it  s presented in a pretty believable way  with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes  where noriko  kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series .  br    br   the animation  for a series made in the   s  is definitely good . the designs are retro   s style of course  but it has it  s charm . animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice  although the costumes do betray  br    br   some of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest . the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too  with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine  strong and vast . the last episode was entirely done in black and white . while it  s generally believed  but not confirmed  that this was done for budget reasons  it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series  which is suited perfectly for the latter part .  br    br   the music is very typical space opera fair . too bombastic in places  very generic  and definitely not worth buying . it does fit the series for the most part  but it can become quite annoying at times . tanaka is not really a famous composer  and the only other respectable series he  s worked on is dragon half . if you think   s anime music  you will know what to expect .  br    br   as the series progresses  the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle  but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this . step by step the drama will be toned down  and the battles will take the front row . neither aspect is ever left completely out though . with the last episode in sight  noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind  and with the last battle in sight  certain questions are presented to the audience  concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy  and how far it can go to guarantee self  preservation . while they are never answered later on  they still present some interesting food for thought . the last episode is very epic  with a nice  but quite predictable ending  though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course . again  it fits the series .  br    br   gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first  with alien invasions  huge battles  and some personal drama  and for the bigger part  it is . but it is done exceptionally well for a change . instead of going for a steady mix of former elements  six episodes long  gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism . along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed  out characters  which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon . the show is very tightly written  although it does tend to slip up at some points . overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided . overall  the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed  sometimes sad  sometimes heroic one . it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre  but at least it bend them a little . highly enjoyable anime classic  but not without flaws .  br    br       \n",
      "here  s a real weirdo for you . it starts out with another take  off on the psycho shower scene  on campus  then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break . the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean . one of the college cuties wanders into the woods  witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open . then it  s lets  rip  off macon county line  time as dean stalks  traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one . tony march is on  target as the evil  shotgun  happy dean . the movie  s overall tone is truly disturbing . the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film it  s also a study in despair . shallow grave is a must for misanthropes  misogynists and nihilists the world over .  \n",

      "tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud . the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself .  br    br   there are a few surprises . as cynical as we are today  i fully expected the  good girl  to be crying over his grave  instead of his buddy  s . especially with her remarks about  going to the funeral of her best friend   when she first meets matt . and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr . allen  s face  blinding him  interesting role by bruce dern  . wrrrooonnnnggg    some of the other hollywood endings do happen  but the writing is so excellent  the acting so carefully wrought that you  re blissfully unaware .  br    br   and the music is out of this world . taking us back to the   s when our  native passions  were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley . even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago  but at a club called  wonderfully   biloxi  with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks . i  ll be watching it again  just to hear the music . good thing i have the factotum sound track  so i can listen to that in the car . watch both together  and you  ll see how matt has matured . . . . playing bar room characters in both . now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc  he probably has great opportunity to do his studies . great actor  just coming into his own . he shows finely nuanced performances . . . the good and the bad in his characters . his  young boy off the farm  is a great study  made especially poignant because of his bassett  hound eyes . he makes love  convincingly as well . since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen  ager  i wonder how that it . . . making love to an actress you kinda grew up with . adds conviction  i  ll say that .  \n",

      "hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was gene roddenberry  s mission . their focus on homosexuality  depression  war  and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other trek series and movies . the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the  seasons of production the acting has improved  the stories are more complex  and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive . in season  episode   countermeasures  there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history . the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting . the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds  but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters . there are also nods to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know . i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked   \n",

      "okay  so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way  but from the beginning  hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances  and have always been willing to mistakes they  ve made . they advice people to see newer episodes first  so they can see just how good the show is  and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes . the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on  screen .  br    br   the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show  as the story lines go from strength to strength . the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines  depression  drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality  and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way  but that is what star trek is and was all about . it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way  dealing with them subtly and smoothly .  br    br   yes  they have used some characters from trek history  but they have done them justice  characters like shelby  lefler and necheyev  vastly underused in the show  had a rebirth in the new frontier books  but they lost their sizzle after a while  when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci  fi  and hf shows those characters in a completely different light  which serves them better .  br    br   the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved . they release bloopers for every episode  so the fans can see what a laugh they have  because they are people doing it in their spare time  with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide  eyed in shock   br    br   what this series  now drawing to a close after  years  has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing  bringing people together  inspiring others to do the same . hf will live for a long time after it ends  as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place .  \n",
      "i kind of consider myself as the   fan of hidden frontier  seeing as i am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys  well  not counting conventions  of course . i have been watching hidden frontier since      and i must say i continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with .  br    br   hidden frontier is the brainchild of rob caves and his self  made studio  areakt pictures  which operates out of the back room of his house . while not as  fancy  as  say  the tos  based series new voyages  which sometimes gets some of the actors  writers from the original series  like walter koenig  aka mr . chekov   rob and the cast and crew of hf manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called  enterprise  . the most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of star trek  s first openly gay character  corey aster  who was introduced in the second season   and his search to find a soul mate . somewhere later in the series  he meets jorian zen  the excelsior  s trill helm officer . in the recent story lines with these two characters  warning major spoiler  do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point    zen is joined to an exiled symbiont  causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with aster . though the future is uncertain  seeing as the most recent episode   beachhead   was just shown to hf fans in the chat room last night  i think that this relationship will endure  but only time will tell .  br    br   gene roddenberry created star trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles . rob caves created hidden frontier for that same reason  and this is what has made this series as popular as it is . as the previous comment stated  i wish i could give it a rating higher than    but it will have to suffice . although next season will be the last  keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by star trek the next generation  i am willing to bet that we will hear much about hidden frontier after that final episode .  \n",
      "this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans  and considering it  s made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it  s story lines are complex and twisting  and it  s characters show realistic depth and dimension . the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking . while it  s first season might be a little shaky  it  s final few are well thought out and well shot . some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise  but these fans don  t take no for an answer . i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike       hidden frontier crew .  br    br   make it so . . .  \n",

      "having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go  one can do nothing but doff one  s hat  a pure masterpiece  which compared to the other le carr minis about smiley  has quite different qualities .  br    br   in the minis about smiley  it is alex guiness  as smiley  who steals the show  the rest of the actors just support him  one can say .  br    br   here it is ensemble and story that  s important  as the lead actor  played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes  isn  t charismatic at all .  br    br   egan just plays a guy called magnus pym  who by lying  being devious and telling people what they like to hear  is very well liked by everyone  big and small . the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex  his czech handler .  br    br   never have the machinery behind a spy  and  or traitor  been told better  after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor . his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into  a perfect spy   as his czech handler calls him .  br    br   and  by following his life  we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path  once you  ve veered off it . he trundles on  even if he never get anything economic out of it  except promotion by his mi  spy masters . everyone  s happy  as long as the flow of faked information continues   br    br   magnus  s father  played wonderfully by ray mcanally  is a no  good con  man  who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money . in later years it is his son who has to bail him out  again and again . but by the example set by his dad and uncle  who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison  and his mom is sent off to an asylum  magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving  not telling the truth . at first he overdoes it a bit  but quickly learn to tell the right lies  and to be constant  not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad .  br    br   his czech handler alex  expertly played by rdiger weigang  creates  with the help of magnus  a network of non  existing informants  which supplies the british mi  with fake information for years  and years  just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war  they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned  liquidated or simply been replaced by mi  men .  br    br   the young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully  and most of them are more charismatic than the older  little more cynic  and tired  pym  played by egan . but you buy the difference easily  as that is often the way we change through life  from enthusiasm to sorrow  or indifference .  br    br   indeed well worth the money   \n",
      "as a fan of author john le carre i  ve slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them . i found this     adaptation of le carre  s masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking i would know what to expect . i was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries  a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama .  br    br   peter egan gives a great performance as magnus pym  the perfect spy of the title . carrying on in the long tradition of le carre  s strong main characters  pym is also quite possibly the best . egan plays pym  who in fact contains many shades of author le carre  as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming  a perfect spy  . egan plays pym to perfection as a man always on the run  if not from others then from himself . egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone .  br    br   surronding egan is a fantastic supporting cast . ray mcanally gives one of his finest performances as pym  s con man father rick who  as le carre has said  is based strongly on the author  s own father . mcanally plays a man who comes in and out of pym  s life and is one of the those responsible for pym becoming  a perfect spy  . in fact if it wasn  t for mcanally  s performance a year after this in a very british coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career .  br    br   the rest of the supporting is excellent as well . from caroline john as pym  s mother to alan howard as his spy mentor to rdiger weigang as the young pym  s friend turned controller to jane booker as pym  s wife the supporting cast is fantastic . special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger pym  jonathan haley  nicholas haley and benedict taylor  who establish the young man who would become the man played so well by peter egan .  br    br   the production values of the miniseries are strong as well . as the miniseries adaptations of tinker  tailor  soldier  spy and smiley  s people proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format . the locations are excellent from the english locations to the those scattered across eastern europe and the usa as are the sets by chris edwards . the cinematography of elmer cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries . yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script .  br    br   screenwrtier arthur hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently . the novel was largely  at least in its early parts  autobiographical in that pym  s early life echoed much of john le carre  s life . the script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of magnus pym from young boy to  a perfect spy  . never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage . if one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight  fist fight  or james bond style car chase this would be the proof . while the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it .  br    br   though it might be overlong for some for those who don  t have very short attention spans here is a must see . from the performances of peter egan and ray mcanally to fine production values and a fine literary script a perfect spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see . it is a fascinating trip down the history of the cold war yet it is more then that . it is also a trip down what john le carre has called  the secret path   the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive . as much a human drama as a spy thriller a perfect spy isn  t to be missed .  \n",
      "this is my second time through for a perfect spy . i watched it  or  years ago and liked it . i like it still . it  s natural that it gets compared to the beeb  s other big le carre  series  tinker tailor soldier spy . tinker tailor focuses on the  game  spies play perfect spy gives us the other axis  what kind of person a spy is . there are a number of themes that these movies share  along with others in the genre .  br    br   ambiguity  moral  sexual  interpersonal  which creates a multidimensional space of true vs . false  inside vs . outside  love vs . responsibility . in a way  these characters are happiest when they are being treated the most shabbily by those they love and respect   backstabbed  in its various nuances .  br    br   the theme of fathers and father  figures is also important . one of the most intriguing characters in a perfect spy is rick  the main character magnus  perhaps ersatz father . throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed . a rogue who always manages to climb back up the ladder when he  s been toppled  who seems impervious to what others think of him  asks magnus each time they meet   do you love your old man   and never   do you love me   maybe it says this somewhere else  but a perfect spy is a love story .  br    br   another theme is that of malignancy . the nature of the business is to turn others  turn them against their government  against their friends and associates  turn them against their values and beliefs . in each of the le carre  movies i have seen  the spy who came in from the cold  looking glass war  tinker tailor soldier spy  smiley  s people  and a perfect spy  turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy .  br    br   finally  not so much a theme as an artistic touch  in each of these films there is usually only a single gun shot  or perhaps two shots bookending the story . violence  torture  cruelty are always just beneath the surface . we see their results not as streams of blood or dank prison cells but in the the objects le carre   s characters cling to as they are ineluctably sucked down into the morass .  br    br   if you haven  t seen the films above  and you enjoy a perfect spy  you are in for a treat . i  d also recommend the sandbagger series  yorkshire tv   the  nd and  rd seasons of which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity . the ipcress file and burial in berlin are nice  though light weight . for political intrigue try a very british coup  house of cards and yes  minister  yes  prime minister .  br    br   if only a brit would set his hand to making the three kingdoms  there would be a film with intrigue and complexity .  \n",
      "this is an extremely long movie  which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting  but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies .  br    br   if you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart  wrenching  because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak . if you can love a monster you  ll cry for magnus pym  the spy who betrays everyone  notably his country  his friends and family  a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people .  br    br   there isn  t one truly likeable character in the entire story  not one loyal   moral  personality to sympathise with . but watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable .  br    br   i really enjoyed it in the end . well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character .  \n",
      "it  s been a long time since i saw this mini  series and i am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time .  br    br   most of the components of  a perfect spy   the adaptation of lecarr  s finest novel  in my opinion  are top  drawer . outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay  the latter written by arthur hopcraft who was also  i believe  the screenwriter for  tinker tailor soldier spy  with alec guinness a few years before .  br    br   the actors are mostly very good  some superb  like alan howard  s jack brotherhood and ray mcanally  s ricky pym . peter egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle . the passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done . so much so that i wondered exactly how old peter egan was at the time of filming . the only jolt comes after the character of magnus pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named benedict taylor to those of a noticeably too  old peter egan  just fresh out of oxford . but this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole .  br    br   egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be  upset  emotionally  ie cry . none of the actors have a very easy time with these moments  aside from the wonderful frances tomelty who plays peggy wentworth for all she  s worth and steals the episode with ease .  br    br   jane booker is annoying as mary pym . she has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife  which mary pym is . rdiger weigang is splendid as axel  amusing  ironic and brilliant . i also enjoyed sarah badel  s camp turn as the baroness .  br    br   the british view of americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes . when the yanks have come abroad to confab with bo brammell  head of mi   the american contingent are portrayed as empty  headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the dictionary and spiced them liberally with american jargon and psycho babble  much to the bemused scorn of the english .  br    br   the humor and sadness are subtly blended . lecarr has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy  yet wistful  atmosphere of the original .  br    br   not a perfect production  what is   and yet the best of the lecarr adaptations to reach film or television to date .  br    br   highly recommended to all spy  thriller lovers and especially lecarr fans . dvd available from acorn .  \n",
      "this is without doubt my favourite le carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for . i read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but i believe this misses the point . all le carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception . it is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set . betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody . pym upbringing is so close to my own that i find it chilling watching . peter egan is in his finest role and the late lamented ray mcanally is unbelievably good . even the smallest roles played by such as andy de la tour  tim healy and jack ellis are spot on . this cast is a theatre impresario  s dream . the story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason . all my sympathies lie with magnus pym and his sole  non sexual  love for poppy  rdiger weigang  as wonderful as always . his only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals . outstanding  rent it  buy it . love it .  \n",
      "without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre  exquisitely transformed into a classic film . performances by peter egan  magnus pym  the perfect spy   rudiger weigang  axel  real name alexander hampel  magnus  czech intelligence controller   ray mcanally  magnus  con  man father  and alan howard  jack brotherhood  magnus  mentor  believer and british controller   together with the rest of the characters  are so perfect and natural  the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award . even the small parts  such as major membury  are performed to perfection . it says a lot for the power of the performances  and the strength of the characters in the novel that  despite the duplicity of magnus  one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of u . s . intelligence . i have read the book at least a dozen times  and watched the movie almost as many times  and continue to be mesmerized by both . if i had one book to take on a desert island  a perfect spy would be the choice above all others .  \n",
      "erotic cinema of the      s was tame compared to the triple x romps of today  which is good . because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes . of course  i wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little . plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods  but it  s worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled the devil  s plaything . but if you don  t care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex  then this isn  t the movie for you . however  i did enjoy it and i give it . . .  stars .  \n",
      "spoilers  classic    s sex trash  the swedish gal  helga  was what made this movie so great . she was beautiful  but what really got to me was how sexual she was . she exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film . her best scenes were when she was  er  stimulating herself . whenever she was on screen  i became transfixed .  br    br   also  the doctor julia  sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film  was very interesting visually . although most   year old girls have bigger breasts than julia  she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes  especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt  also grabbed my attention unmercilessly . you also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid i don  t know if i  ve ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time . classic stuff   \n",
      "well  if you are looking for a great mind control movie  this is it . no movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control  and naked . marie forsa  as the busty helga  is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she isn  t . one wishes they made more movies like this one .  \n",
      "michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name  including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out . iphigenia  however  is a highlight . adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides  it  s a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel . the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a  big  film  with the emphasis placed on the simple story in supplication to the gods  king agamemnon  kostas kazakos  is compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia  tatiana papamoschou   much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae  irene papas  . kazakos and papas are both outstanding  but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen  blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game . strongly recommended for fans of international cinema .  \n",
      "well the story is a little hard to follow the first time  but that  s only because of all the bare breasted    s painted  up vampire  witches dancing to the bongo drums . this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies . and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them . and for girl on girl action  vampiric or not . . . this movie just rocks     \n",
      "this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph w . sarno . it features plenty of soft core sex  really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women . the acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well  made . marie forsa is one of the hottest chicks i have ever seen in a horror movie  it  s a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body . sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies . a must see for fans of sexploitation   \n",
      "the devil  s plaything is my second attempt at a joseph sarno production  and although i will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic swedish wildcats  it is still a little slow and un  explicit for my taste .  br    br   this one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle  that want to resurrect their previously murdered  leader  . in order to do so  the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff  and of course drink some blood  too . when a doctor and her brother  s car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging  they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires . . . but they may not be as helpless as they seem . . .  br    br   the devil  s plaything is a pretty good example of early    s exploit sleaze . lots of nudity  including some full  frontal  some sleazy undertones  including incest and of course  lesbo  bloodsucking . . . but these scenes are still pretty tame by today  s standards . some pretty hot women in this one  would have benefited from some more explicit sex  but i guess ya can  t have it all . also would have benefited from some heavier violence  gore  being that it is a vampire film  but i think the purpose of the devil  s plaything was more to showcase skin  not blood . still a little slow  and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden  but that  s to be expected from something from this era and of this budget . worth a look to exploit fans  others may find it a little too dull for their liking .      \n",

      "this splendidly  directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm . it is a first  class adventure for many reasons  i suggest   fine photography  strong imaginative qualities  a delightful cast  good simulated  jungle locales and a very exciting storyline . johnny weissmuller plays tarzan  a mono  syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs  creation but he is honest  loyal  brave and very courageous  and he needs to be during this narrative . as jane parker  his wife who had been jane porter in the novels  maureen o  sullivan is very attractive and lively  as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality . the effect of the lighting  the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual . this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back  lot which really works . the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed but into their idyll come people searching from them  emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated . one is harry holt  still in love with her  who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him the gown and perfumes interest her  but she refuses to leave tarzan . tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals  in scenes that look like a humanized king king . the group claim to want to hunt animals  and tarzan agrees for jane  s sake to a bit of big game trapping but at some point  the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition  s heads  minds . tarzan is shot  left for dead and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous  elephant  s graveyard  . but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions . tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call in a most spectacular elephant  filled scene  he saves jane and what is left of the expedition  who return home little richer but much wise  as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband . the film was directed by set  design wizard cedric gibbons  and quite beautifully too . his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film  which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish . neil hamilton is a very good harry  paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad . forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally . an unusual and well  realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well . recommended .  \n",
      "this was the second of the series of   classic tarzan  movies featuring johnny weismuller in the title role and maureen o  sullivan as jane .  br    br   as usual  this was a wonderful film in this series and perhaps stands out as an  in between  film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early     s into the     s . as such  it displayed good pace  though not as good as subsequent films . likewise  the cinematography is less accomplished than later tarzan films in this series . the stock i saw was of uneven quality  containing some grainy scenery and some under  exposed and over  exposed scenes . the crisp display of later tarzan films is lacking here . on the other hand  there is one scene  very early on  in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swishing in front of it as the camera backs up  showing safari men forging ahead into the jungle  was really almost modern in its style  and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie .  br    br   regarding plot  one interesting feature here was jane  s near  fickleness and inconstancy  when she was being subject to martin  s flirtations . the kiss  and jane  s stunned  and partly guilty  reaction  foreshadow something of the jane we see in the future as well in these films . compare  for example  in tarzan finds a son  jane  s duplicitous actions tricking tarzan and delivering boy to his family . later she admits to tarzan that she was wrong . here  nothing quite so explicit  but we have jane  returning  to the jane parker of yesteryear  and in an almost repentant series of actions  stripping herself of the evening gown brought by martin and harry to entice her away from tarzan .  br    br   there were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing .  br    br   for one thing  the picture we get of the domestic life of tarzan is here  as later  a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death . this to me is very much at the core of the tarzan experience .  br    br   i was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today  s standards .  br    br   there were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure tarzan leading the elephants into the valley of the elephants  graveyard tarzan being rescued from watery death by the hippo  and then nursed to health by the apes cheetah going to find tarzan when jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment cheetah in particular crossing the river on the log . the final battle scenes of savages  lions on the ground and savages  apes in the trees . jane  showing us that she is truly of tarzan  s world now  quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away .  br    br   the final series of scenes is splendid suddenly tarzan is on the scene  flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions  and summoning the elephants to the rescue  that final cry of tarzan in triumph  holding a happy jane in his arms  with a dancing and delighted cheetah beside them  is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of tarzan and jane .  br    br   all in all  this is another wonderful classic tarzan movie . i would recommend this movie strongly to anyone .  \n",
      "  tarzan and his mate   the second of mgm  s tarzan pictures  picks up a year after the events of  tarzan the ape man  . tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle  and harry holt  one of the expeditioners in the first film  returns  this time accompanied by the less  than  honorable martin arlington  in quest of the ivory from the elephants  graveyard . naturally  a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way .  br    br   the first film romanticized everything   the jungle  adventure  romance itself  wild animals  and even death . the second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences  but a more serious tone underlies the action . the characters dare to ask questions like what if something happened to tarzan  what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself  while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation  it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn  t always as much fun as the throw  caution  to  the  wind attitude of the original .  br    br   one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane  s relationship . tarzan still speaks very broken english  but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate . additionally  their love for each other has really blossomed  and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle .  br    br   most people consider  tarzan and his mate  superior to the original  tarzan the ape man  . personally  i liked the first film just a little bit better . the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt  martin arlington team isn  t nearly as likable as holt  s relationship with james parker  jane  s father  from the original . the mr . arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain  but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie . the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him .  also  i don  t want to give anything away  but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him  jane never finds out about those events  so the ending isn  t quite as satisfying as it could have been .  all of these detractors are relatively minor  however  and it  s still a great movie .  br    br   like the first film   tarzan and his mate  has amazing action scenes  wonderful wildlife footage  and one of the screen  s all  time greatest romances . if you liked the first film in the series  this is definitely a sequel to see .  \n",
      "when i was a kid it was lex barker  s time as tarzan . i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller  was  tarzan and i wouldn  t understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller  s last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape . it wasn  t after many years that i came across  tarzan and his mate   and then i understood . weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker  gordon scott  jock mahoney  denny miller  miles o  keefe and cristopher lambert .  br    br   as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o  sullivan a strong  self minded  active and  no  inhibitions  woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made  tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn  t kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it   such behaviors were unthinkable with the  janes  to come such as brenda joyce  vanessa brown  virginia huston or dorothy hart  all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle .  br    br   o  sullivan character  s sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself  except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily the combination is perfect . another highlight in the movie is cheeta  s secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day .  br    br    tarzan and his mate  stands as a fine product in its genre  tarzan films  and perhaps as the best  though i have to admit that i also enjoyed  tarzan  s greatest adventure        made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast  and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect  all gymnasium  physical looks that doesn  t fit for a rustic ape man  .  br    br   good for jane and her mate   \n",
      "like tarzan the ape man        only more so . there  s more of everything  more animals  more varied african tribes  and scenes in which the thought must be  if this was good with three or four lions  forty would be better . tarzan wrestles with crocodilesthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin  around and around  jaws flapping . tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still . tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals . his friends are real chimps  people wearing larger ape costumes  and elephants . in fact  they use indian elephantsfar more friendly and trainable than african oneswith costume ears attached to their heads . the human story another white man  worse than the rest  shows up to join with holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard . tarzan won  t show them the way  so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed . tarzan intercedes  and the bad guy shoots himbut  of course  he survives and returns to save jane . everybody else dies  holt and the bad guy and every single one of their  boys .  people are expendable  especially africans  and there doesn  t seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them . this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes . there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude  and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing . apparently one of weismuller  s friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes  and not maureen o  sullivan . she  however  moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears  plus a bikini top   showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip . they still don  t need to talk a lot . they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities . no wonder they  re happy .  \n",
      "i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you  re planning a romantic evening with him  her . the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o  sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen .  br    br   after the original film  we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other . jane  s skimpy jungle wear and tarzan  s protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically  but also quite sexually in love .  br    br   one  s imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan  jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally  romantically and sexually . and jane  s student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality .  br    br   the skin show in this film is off the charts . in addition to jane  s two  piece sexy midriff  leg  and hip baring costume  she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan .  although it is not o  sullivan  but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene  weissmuller  also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth . the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell  with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips .  br    br   it  s a shame that the over  protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry . although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come  they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie .  \n",
      "as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies . unlike others however  i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like . plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle . in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made . this occurs when harry  s safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals . the pre  censorship production values add a lot of realism  genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle . the film also offers  though perhaps antecedently  an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers . in addition sexy jane  thousands of elephants  some great sets and two chetas  not to be missed an adventure classic .  \n",
      "considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films  i have no argument with that  although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining . one thing it  s the longest of the series that i  ve seen at    minutes . i  ve only seen six of them but this was longer than i  m used to and with the drawn  out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long .  br    br   nonetheless  it is a good mixture of action  suspense and romance . the only things missing are color and stereo sound . the primitive special  effects don  t bother me  as that was all that they had back in the     s .  br    br   among some  this film is most noted for one thing skin   jane  never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays  code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made . her outfit showed what a great figure maureen o  sullivan possessed . the nude underwater scene  however  was not her  by a longshot . the woman under the water didn  t have a good figure at all  whoever it was .  br    br   there is plenty of action in here . up to the finale  it was not overdone  either . the ending went on for   minutes  though  and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch .  br    br   still  this movie offers about everything  except  boy   their adopted son   you  d want to see in a tarzan film  even o  sullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times . with her pair of  lungs   that was no problem .  \n",
      "there  s something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in     can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it  including the bloated and boring     s piece greystoke . once the viewer gets past the first three scenes  which are admittedly dull  tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot  offering non  stop action  humor  and romance . maureen o  sullivan is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie . weismuller is solid as well . highly recommended .  \n",
      "although the recent re  telling of part of homer  s epic  troy  with brad pitt was entertaining once   iphigenia  with the incandescent irene pappas is breathtaking . unfolding in a natural setting with greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity . a chance encounter with this film on one of directv  s many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems . there is no glitter or  bling  in this movie  just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil . i think even homer  if he really existed  would be proud of this telling .  br    br   jlh  \n",
      "the release of tarzan the ape man  in      caused a sensation . it may be hard to believe    years later  but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix  or the lord of the rings has achieved  at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment . tarzan became an instant pop icon  the  noble savage  that every woman fantasized about  and every man wished he could be . the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice burroughs  who  while he  d agreed to mgm  s creative liberties  and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks  felt the  dumbed down  version of his character  with no plans to allow him to  grow   was unfaithful to his vision  he would start a production company  and soon be making his own  tarzan  films  . mgm  realizing the value of it  s newest  star   knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original . . . and tarzan and his mate delivered   br    br   the film had an interesting back story cedric gibbons  mgm  s legendary art director  had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel  prior to the release of tarzan the ape man  despite the fact that he  d never directed before  the studio hadn  t anticipated the film  s impact  and didn  t think a novice director would matter much on a  novelty  film . . . and they wanted to keep their oscar  winning department chief happy  . gibbons  a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist  loved the freedom of pre  code hollywood  and decided to have tarzan and his mate  push the envelope  to the limit . . . tarzan and jane would frolic in a nude swim  and jane would appear topless through most of the film . maureen o  sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death  in      that while a double was used for the swim  she trusted the studio  and did  a couple of days  of filming sans top . . . but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples  and the idea was abandoned  the film shot those days would be worth a fortune   she did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent  flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her  swim   and donned a revised  jungle  costume that was extremely provocative  very thin  and open at the sides . . . and the resulting outcry would help  create  the hays office  and the self  censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry .  br    br   mgm yanked gibbons from the production  the  official  reason given was his workload as art director   and veteran jack conway was listed as the new director  to appease the critics . . . although james c . mckay actually directed the film  as conway was busy on  other projects  including viva villa   br    br   the film incorporated the best elements of the original  safaris  murderous tribes  tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save jane   and actually improved on the storytelling . harry holt  neil hamilton   from the first film  returns to africa for ivory from the  elephants  graveyard   and to try to seduce jane into returning to england  with gifts of silk dresses  underwear  and perfume . he brings with him martin arlington  paul cavanagh   a crack shot and inveterate womanizer  who sneers at holt  s chivalrous pursuit of jane  and stalks her as a potential  conquest   to be had by any means  including killing tarzan  if and when he can get away with it without being seen  .  br    br   tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with jane  and puts his foot down  refusing to allow the hunters into the graveyard . arlington finds his opportunity  catching the ape man alone  and shoots him  then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise . now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle  and she can direct them to the graveyard  before her long voyage back to england  comforted by the oh  so  sympathetic arlington . but a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group . . . can tarzan  being nursed back to health by his ape  family   recover in time to save jane   br    br   while stock footage is again used extensively  the racial stereotypes of the   s are apparent  and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits  tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other  tarzan  film  as well as a sexiness that even bo derek  s blatantly erotic tarzan  the ape man couldn  t touch . johnny weissmuller was in peak condition  physically  maureen o  sullivan was never more beautiful  and  africa  never looked more romantic  and dangerous .  br    br   tarzan and his mate was a triumph  although it would be drastically edited for many years   and remains the classic of the series  to this day   \n",

      "this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a   year old kid in     when it was shown on a los angeles television station  s  late show  . the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture  and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape  nor is it ever shown on television  apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart  the playwright  producer  director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii   the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than   years after it was made  . i did not see the movie again for over   years  when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a  bootlegged  copy on vhs  poor video quality  but good audio  . my memory of it was correct it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch . an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars  just starting out in their careers at the time       went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well  known and fully  employed actors  e . g . judy holliday  edmond o  brien  jeanne crain  barry nelson  don taylor  karl malden  peter lind hayes  george  superman   reeves  red buttons  lee j . cobb  kevin mccarthy  and gary merrill  . the scenes with the b    liberators are terrific  especially the close  up shots where the details of the giant  for those times    engine bomber  then        manufactured  now nearly extinct  can be seen . good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot  cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew  of course  very gender  biased as was the trend of the day only the men became pilots  the women just supported them in their roles   hardly acceptable in today  s world  . i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy .  \n",

      "this movie is a ripoff of james cain  s novel  the postman always rings twice . apparently  the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story   perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties  despite this  the movie isn  t really just an italian version of the hollywood movie . in some ways it  s a lot better and in other ways  it is definitely not .  br    br   the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people . in fact  the male and female lovers are a bit icky  looking . the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair  particularly on the back and shoulders  and his lady love is  to put it frankly  unattractive . they are a very  very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version . and the ill  fated husband is really  really obese and loves to walk around shirtless   and his counterpart in the american film  cecil kellaway is definitely better looking  and probably better looking than the other two italian leads  actually  . and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian film   since i just could not imagine a finely coiffed  dish  like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellaway   i am     sure she would have had dozens of better offers  whereas  the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable .  br    br   part of the italian film  s believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex . the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway  they never actually get around to sex  this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic . in addition to the casual sexuality of the film  it  s also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life   with lots of sweaty people  a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath .  br    br   the movie is also pretty fast  paced compared to the over  long american film . and what you get due to brevity isn  t all good . the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american film   with grainier footage  relatively poor orchestration and sets . it sure ain  t a pretty film  but the neo  realistic  like style makes the film seem more realistic . but it cannot make up for the short  cuts in the plot . many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over . and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american film   and misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats  the best part of the american film  .  br    br   so which is the better film  well  a lot of this probably depends on you . as for me  the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic  though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles    but it packed a great ending . and the italian film was much  much more realistic   until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed . so neither film is exactly great  but i  d give my nod to the italian one being a bit better . it  s too bad they couldn  t have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film .  \n",
      "the ruth snyder  judd gray murder in     inspired ogden nash to write a broadway play called machinal . more famously  it inspired james m . cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with  double indemnity and the postman always rings twice . both became film noir classics of the      s  double indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made . some of the real  life elements of the snyder  gray story were captured by cain  the old age and indifference of albert gray  ruth  s high sex drive  ruth and judd  s passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause . missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban manhattan  albert snyder being a respected newspaper editor . the numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase .  br    br   cain  s double indemnity was filmed perfectly by billy wilder  let  s ignore stanwyck  s ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore  the postman always rings twice  however  was filmed thrice and ossessione  an italian version and luchino visconti  s first film  was the first of three versions . before commenting on it  i  ll recommend the lana turner  john garfield version of     in its entirety and five minutes of the     jack nicholson  jessica lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table .  br    br   ossessione is not as noirish as the postman always rings twice . it has a strong neo  realist look which makes it a great movie  but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing . it does not have low  key lighting and unconventional camera angles . the dialog is not hard  boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization . this is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization . its also a lot more sexual than the lana turner version . we have a very obvious adulterous relationship and giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac . a new character is introduced into the story  la spagnola  with very obvious homosexual overtones . there is also a small  but very well  played role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute .  br    br   this is a far greater study of the working class than of crime . the audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime . the drifter is a complete tramp  the wife is no lana turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage . her husband is an obscene capitalist  obese  rude and arrogant . i think the casting was brilliant for this film . my only beef is with the overlong running time . everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical . nevertheless  fans of noir and realism will definitely like ossessione  as i did .  \n",
      "well  i  d heard from somewhere that ossessione is a precursor to the italian film genre  and particular favourite of mine  the  giallo  . . . but actually  aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in italy the two have pretty much no relation . in the sixties and seventies  italian film  makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful american film released . they  ve not done that here  but ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later american film  the postman always rings twice   without giving the book  s author  james m . cain  so much as a credit  anyway  the plot focuses on gino costa  a handsome drifter who  by chance  stumbles upon a caf where a woman named giovanna bragana works . he soon learns that she  s married to giuseppe a big fat annoying man  whom giovanna can  t stand to have even touching her . he wants the pair of them to run away together  but she  s not so keen on the idea . however  fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful . . .  br    br   despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it  s based on  it has to be said that director luchino visconti implements the film noir style well  and in a way i even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger american noir classics . the story is  as you would expect  extremely strong and the visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast . visconti drags the film out a little bit too much  however  and with a running time of almost    minutes  i felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length . i almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at ossessione as it is a good film  but it  s not a  great  film . the relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly  and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters  heads . there  s not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what  s going on  and by not always focusing on the characters themselves the film is not as interesting as it could have been . still  it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason . . . although it  s not as good as the     version of the same james m . cain classic .  \n",
      "with iphigenia  mikhali cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient greek theatre to the screen . his own screenplay  an adaptation of euripides  tragedy  was far from easy  compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed . the story has been very carefully deconstructed from euripides  version and placed in a logical  strictly chronological framework  better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story  telling . cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in euripides  tragedy odysseus  calchas  and the army . this was done in order to make some of euripides  points regarding war  the church  and government clearer . finally  cacoyannis  iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to euripides  .  br    br   the film was shot on location at aulis . the director of photography  giorgos arvanitis  shows us a rugged but beautiful greece  where since the homeric days time seems to have stood still . he takes advantage of the bodies  the arid land  the ruins  the intense light and the darkness . the harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters . the camera uses the whole gamut of available shots  from the very long  reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape  as well as the human scale involved  to the extreme close  ups  dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters . in particular  the film  s opening  with a bold  accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats  followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach  is a very effective means of communicating agamemnon  s awesome political and military responsibility .  br    br   no word but  sublime  can describe the stunning performances of costa kazakos  agamemnon   irene papas  clytemnestra   and tatiana papamoschou  iphigenia  . kazakos and papas embody the sublimity of the classical greece tragedy . kazakos  character is extremely down  to  earth  and his powerful look into the camera  more than his words  reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul . irene papas is the modern quintessence of classic greek plays . in iphigenia  she is terrible in her anguish  and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance . tatiana papamoskou  in her first role on the screen  is outstanding in her portray of the innocent iphigenia  which contrasts with kazakos  austere depiction of her father  agamemnon .  br    br   cacoyannis is faithful to euripides in his representation of the other characters odysseus is a sly  scheming politician  achilles  a vain  narcissistic warrior  menalaus is self centered  obsessed with his honor  eager to be avenged  and to have his wife and property restored .  br    br   the costumes and sets are realistic no hollywood there . agamemnon  s quarters resembles a barn  he dresses  as do the others  in utilitarian  hand  woven  simple garb . clytemnestra  s royal caravan is made up of rough  hewn wooden carts .  br    br   the music is by the prolific contemporary music composer mikis theodorakis . theodorakis  score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding  reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy  and accentuates its dimensions and actuality .  br    br   this film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization . it teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures . euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love  and reflects on woman  s vulnerable position in a world of manly violence . in his adaptation of euripides  tragedy  cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern  clear  and dramatic fashion .  br    br   the relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer . with the possible exception of menelaus  whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife  s elopement with her lover  everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with troy  which has nothing to do with helen the thirst for power  agamemnon   greed  the army  odysseus   or glory  achilles  . and so in a real sense  helen became the wmd of the trojan war . the war  stripped of all homeric glamor and religious sanctioning  was just an imperialist venture  spurred primarily by the desire for material gain  all else being a convenient pretext .  br    br   another conflict raised in the film is that between the church and the state . calchas  who represents the church  feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy agamemnon for the insult to the goddess he serves  tells him to sacrifice his daughter . in consenting to the sacrifice  the king comes closer to his moral undoing  but in refusing  loses his power over the masses  his army   who are brainwashed by religion . of course  for agamemnon  it  s a game . the king must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the gods or not  until he realizes  too late  that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide .  br    br   is it a sacrifice or a murder  and how can we tell the difference between the two  by focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice   and  worst of all  the sacrifice of one  s own child   euripides  cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal . it touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society . in the case of iphigenia  however  as in the biblical tale of abraham and isaac  the father is asked to kill his own child  by his own hand . what sort of god would insist on such payment  can it be just or moral  even if divinely inspired  finally  does the daughter  s sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war  these are many deep questions raised by a two  hour film .  \n",

      "ossessione  br    br   luchino visconti  s debut film  this italian noir is generally credited with launching the neorealist movement   well  it says so right on the back of the box   and is a sometimes penetrating  sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux . set in fascist italy  an assortment of supporting characters   including an ingenuous drifter who espouses communist virtues   embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without  drifting phantasms longing for a soul . although visconti  s compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well  developed  the spider web of deceit is tenuous   although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale  gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it   the cosmic irony too didactic  the illicit relationship strained with bathos . all the same  it  s incisive and essential  although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable .  \n",
      "audiences today will probably watch a film like ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out . the structure of the film really divorces from sap  happy hollywood conventionsas well as other major theatrical elements . it relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light . films of this naturethe neo  realist filmswere made to reflect the darkness felt during post  world war ii times . ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war  including adultery  conspiracy  murder  pregnancy  etc . aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments  the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty shot on  location  uses natural lighting and most likely non  popular actors . all of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film  yielding the following theme negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally .  br    br   the two leadsgino and giovannaare polar opposites  yet both carry the mentality we  re bored and we want to be entertained . gino is a drifter a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations . giovanna is a bored house  wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence she doesn  t want to leave her home and husband  but would rather remain where she is because it  s safer . gino  s lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle giovanna craves the only difference is that she  s too afraid to live it herselfthat  s why she falls in love with gino he represents everything she wants but doesn  t have the courage to get . she wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandgino is the perfect ticket into that world . the affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the    s feeling somewhat uneasy . i mean  films prior to the neo  realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before . to say the least it was probably a bit alarming .  br    br   in conjunction with the theme  the neo  realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior . succinctly put  adulterous behavior  as shown in the film  leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives . when gino and giovanna conspire with each other to  eliminate  giovanna  s husband  karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done . they return to their home the atmosphere is dark and biting  as can be expected from the neo  realist style  . they are not happy they  re actually more depressed . they thought that by eliminating giovanna  s husband that they  d live happier lives  but they were duped . the film ends with giovanna  s deathit being in karmic similitude of her husband  s death . i think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons . here  s why .  br    br   there  s a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen  and if so  to what extent . i think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified  but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have . as the subtext of ossessione asks  is adultery and murder evil  i think the film eagerly responds yes  the adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are . ironically though  towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other  s arms inside the car  the author of the film shows that their happiness is  in fact  a faade the car crashes off the cliff and into the river  killing giovanna the police arrest gino . i think it was the author  s intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior  in the end karma will come back to haunt them . i agree . i think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times . this was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that gino and giovanna experience in their relationship he can  t handle the pressure of living in giovanna  s husband shadow  so he leaves giovanna and sleeps with another girl . such is typical of the insatiable  hedonistic personality .  br    br   all in all  the film seemed very risky for its time . the audience  however  was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought . those pre  war  happy  go  lucky films were no longer being believed . movie  going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so  called  sin  because it was a reflection of their own life problems . ossessione  then  acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading . that is  a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo  realist film movement .  \n",
      "oh  those sneaky italians . it  s not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the  in this case  author of the novel . of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema  mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it . james m . cain  s publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until     but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic .  br    br   the movie is not as great to watch as the     american version but it  s a great movie nevertheless . this of course not in the least is due to the movie it  s great strong story  that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism . it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story  with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment .  br    br   leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it . these early drama  s always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch . unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end  when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts . the movie could had easily ended   minutes earlier .  br    br   nevertheless  i don  t really have much else negative to say about this movie . it  s simply a greatly made one  based on some equally great and strong source material . quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti  who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies .  br    br        \n",
      "visconti  s first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique  accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and  best of all  clara calamai as the fabulous  frantic giovanna . remade several times as  the postman rings twice  but never bettered . can  t believe this was the man  s first film  it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career .  \n",
      "i  m not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cain  s novel  the postman always rings twice   i  m not even sure if viscounti acquired the book  s rights   but the resulting movie is definitely interesting . it is not the best version of cain  s story  i like the     version best   but thanks to visconti  s excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti  a very sensual couple   it is a must for noir fans . visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect . the film is not perfect  though . my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace  i don  t think visconti was very good at editing his films  . i think film noir works better with a short running time . fortunately  calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested . anyhow  as much as i like this film and the remakes  i think no one has made the definitive version of cain  s much  praised book .  \n",
      "when people nowadays hear of a     s drama  they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it  s another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic  melancholic roles . this opinion  however  does not resemble neorealist movies  in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti . ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others . the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these   years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself  exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past . at the same time  while being based on the novel by james m . cain  the postman always rings twice  it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style  view  his own art . i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which i  d like to entail below .  br    br   first  visconti  s movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life  in particular those absorbed by desire . these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face . gino  massimo girotti  a traveler with  bear like shoulders  turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern . although many people go there to have a meal  gino occurs to get something more  much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna  clara calamai  a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar  mr giuseppe bragana  juan de landa  . her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love  the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together . . . however  are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire  can one build love upon murder  what is love and what is loyalty  does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession  such questions intensely arise while watching the movie  when  to the core  the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters .  we have to love each other affectionately  answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything   isn  t it what we both wanted  says one of the couple . . . it occurs that it  s not . therefore  the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart . yet  it constantly remains thought provoking .  br    br   second  ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography  which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power . these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost   years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch . they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots . who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl  a sort of  ragazza perfetta   perfect girl   a dancer anita and buys her ice cream . his desires show him totally different direction . . . do viewers remain indifferent at gino  giovanna  s first meeting  the first focus of camera is on giovanna  s legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences . a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look .  br    br   third  ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast . massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet  consequently  what comes out is a flawless acting . he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim  which represents conscience . his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo  elio marcuzzo  whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona . clara calamai  who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused  fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple . they are both very convincing . besides  i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art . in some of his most witty moments  he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance .  br    br   in sum  we  as modern viewers who are capable of critical view  have to look at this film very objectively . it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned  it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet  is it educational  visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity . in such case  his films would only entertain  which is  of course  not entirely fellini  s style  too  . visconti always had something to convey . what did he want to say here  is the film against bad marriage  or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire  the final shocking moments say for themselves . though you don  t have to agree with the vision  ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film  one of visconti  s best      \n",
      "a deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe an impoverished giovanna has ended up in the gutter  but still has an ace up her sleeve beauty and youth . bragana  a fat  bellied gas station tenant  who has been getting on in years  picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection . but the physical contact that giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust  and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of .  br    br   the arrival of gino  a young migrant worker  finally provides her the longed  for opportunity . and you don  t have to ask her twice at the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired  and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance .  br    br   the developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by giovanna though . gino  s yearning for freedom is suppressed  his desire to leave the place with giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside . giovanna aims at another goal to get bragana killed  to inherit and  in addition to that  to collect the insurance premium . in her hands gino degenerates into a self  sacrificing tool . being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold  blooded killer .  br    br   but in contrast to giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level . the very taking over of bragana  s place  which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man  causes a deep loathing of himself . and later  after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through giovanna  s cunningly devised plan  he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute .  br    br   if visconti  s film ended at this point  it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool  calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism . but then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse . at last giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done  and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew gino  s love . her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate . it also affects us  while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster . the culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start .  br    br    \n",
      "to get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track  not only the music  but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery . how beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity  note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside giovanna  s marriage . don  t expect to find much here of the political life of italy in     . that  s not what this is about . on the other hand  if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds  you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo  realism . by the end of the film we there are moments antonioni  like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places . this is one of my favorite visconti films .  \n",

      "ossessione  adapted loosely  or if it is as loose or close to the version i saw of james m . cain  s the postman always rings twice with jack nicholson and jessica lange i can  t be certain  by first time director luchino visconti  is no less outstanding with usage of mis  en  scene  music  both diegetic and non  diegetic   and the acting . i didn  t know what to expect visconti to do in his approach to the material  after seeing la terra trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit . but this is a totally character and emotional based drama  bordering on melodrama  however  without the conventions that bog down lesser ones   and with the style in the finest path of the budding film  noir movement  visconti creates a debut that  s as involving as any other neo  realist film . neo  realism  by the way  could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather  along with de sica  s the children are watching us   which that would take shape after the war . although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo  realist efforts  it  s dealt with in a bare  bones storytelling fashion  and it  s laced with other familiar themes in neo  realism  the lower  class  death  desperation  .  br    br   aside from the story  which is simply as it is described on this site  the artistry with which visconti captures the images  and then layers them with objects  a shawl over gino costa  s profile when in guilt   shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film  usually over gian and giovanna   and the feel of the italian streets in many of the exterior scenes . domenico scala and aldo tonti  who would lens some of rossellini and fellini  s films  help in envisioning the look of ossessione  which is usually moving in on a character  then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces  their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly  sad and dark and romantic . i think i  ve just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along  even as i was in fear of the futures of the two leads . the two leads  massimo girotti and clara calamai  portray all the compelling  truthful  and near  operatic emotions  and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes .  br    br   it  s a brilliant  crushing adaptation  and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for visconti in his career .  \n",

      "luchino visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries . the great directors of italy of the   s and   s were men who understood the medium  but it was luchino visconti  a man of vision  who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing . he clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with  ossessione   a film based on james cain  s  the postman always ring twice   which was later made by hollywood  but that version pales in comparison with what visconti achieved in the movie . luchino visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited alberto moravia  a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings .  br    br   the film has been well preserved in the dvd format we watched recently . the film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how visconti  s vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way  something the american version lacked .  br    br   what comes across watching the movie  is the intensity which the director got from his key players . the magnificent clara calamai does an amazing job as giovanna  the woman who has married an older man  but when gino appears in her life  all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life . giovanna is one of the best creations in ms . calamai  s achievements in the italian cinema . the last sequence of the film shows ms . calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed .  br    br   equally excellent is massimo girotti  one of the best actors of his generation who appears as gino  the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in giovanna . gino is the perfect man for giovanna  something that mr . girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen . mr . girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy  yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent . juan delanda is seen as giuseppe  the older man who fell in love with giovanna . in fact  his character rings truer than his counterpart in the american film  where he is seen more as a buffoon .  br    br   the film is beautifully photographed by domenic scala and aldo tonti . they gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way italian directors of the era favored . the original musical score of giuseppe rosati is perfect . visconti  a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors  also includes arias by bizet and verdi that fit well in the context of the movie .  br    br    ossessione  is a film to treasure because we see a great luchino visconti at the top of his form .  \n",
      "  some spoilers  i have not read the james m . cain novel  the postman always rings twice   on which this movie was based  so i cannot compare this film version to it  but i have seen and love the     us version  also entitled postman   .  br    br   even better is this gem from italy  which  i have read  was mutilated  in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime . well  no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema  apparently the forerunner of the neo  realist movement in film  making . one can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on  a pervading sense of societal and cultural  as well as personal oppression remains  hanging heavy over the protagonists  who therefore face many limits in life .  br    br   consider gino  the young drifter  not well educated  unemployed  and resorting to stowing away  stealing and conning people in order to get by  his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless .  br    br   in giovanna  he sees a way out  yet he should have kept going  as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money  her job  working at the trattoria for her husband  slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen   and her sex . in the past  she had limited options  and decided to marry the restaurant  gas station owner  giuseppe bregana  played by juan de landa  anyway  knowing that he would not make her happy . she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches her .  br    br   on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part  which he has in fact pocketed   gino wins bregana  s favor  promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life  or lack thereof  and is left alone with giovanna . they immediately start a heated  passionate  yet volatile love affair .  br    br   gino soon feels stifled by the relationship  and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband . wanting no part of it  gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford  kindly paid for him by another gypsy  type man named spagnolo  a fellow train passenger . to gino  spagnolo represents a sort of freedom  and they become friends  spagnolo also symbolizes gino  s morality and conscience   traveling and finding work at a carnival together . finally gino has steady employment . to his dismay  he is not yet over his love for giovanna   a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go back home  to live and work with them again  as he is handy to have around .  br    br   too weak  willed to resist  knowing this will reunite he and giovanna  gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple . after a while he gives in to gina  s demands to get rid of her husband . once the evil deed is done  giovanna becomes more cold  blooded than ever  seeming to have very little conscience  while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm . as much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly  they are now inextricably linked  and must face the consequences .  br    br   i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into gino  s life to act as a judge of his misdeeds  that was very good  and interesting  adding another dimension to the story .  br    br   while the    u . s . version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters  especially the cops and the lawyers  ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone . this gives the final outcome even more potency  and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live .  br    br   a minor quibble the amount of time  hardly any  that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers  how quickly they kill the husband  there is no botched first attempt as in the u . s . version   gino  s very quick  to  escalate relationship with the dancer  hooker  they quickly profess their love as well  and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met   all rather unrealistic  isn  t it  i found this time  frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere . otherwise  well worth the viewer  s time . the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout . recommended .  \n",
      "visconti  s first feature  ossessione is an adaptation of james m . cain  s the postman always rings twice . now  i  m not familiar with that book or the other film versions  but i am a big fan of cain  s double indemnity  much more so than i am a fan of billy wilder  s film version of it  in fact  . the two novellas seem like they must be very similar . both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her . giovanna  the woman in this italian version  played very well by clara calamai  is not evil incarnate like the wife in double indemnity  but she seems very spoiled . her husband  a great performance by juan de landa  is a bit cruel to her  but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him . he  s older than her and unattractive  so she  s rather fickle . when gino shows up  a young  muscular man  it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed . she sweats she wants to be with him forever  but she  s stuck with her husband . they break up at first  but when they meet again  they  apparently  although this is intentionally vague  plan to murder the husband . they are successful  and they move back to the woman  s home town to run the bar that her husband owned . gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea . he wants giovanna  but the one thing that he certainly doesn  t want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life . their relationship quickly crumbles . ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters . it  s always fascinating  but it does go on a bit too long . at two hours and twenty  two minutes  i can  t  for the life of me  figure out how it took that long  this is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that visconti was inventing within this film . it was  after all  the first film that won that label . we see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life  without any hurrying to the next plot point . i  ve seen many of visconti  s films  and the only one i like better than this one is rocco and his brothers       . his direction is as great as it ever was  with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect . i also feel the need to point out the film  s best performance  by dhia christiani as a young  exotic  dancer and part  time prostitute named anita whom gino meets after he begins to try to break away from giovanna . she  s only in the film for maybe five or six minutes  and she has only a few lines . it  s shocking how much visconti and christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time . she  s absolutely heartbreaking .     .  \n",
      "this is a haunting  powerful italian adaptation of james m . cain  s novel the postman always rings twice directed by the great luchino visconti . what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it  s source material to become something bolder and more original  interestingly camus also credits cain  s novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger  . the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of cain  s narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender . cain  s very american novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness  the lead character cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant   which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in . this allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate  doomed love affair of the two main characters . this film is a complex  suspenseful  rewarding experience .  \n",
      "watching  ossessione  today   more than  decades later   is still a powerful experience  especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how italian filmmakers changed movies forever  roughly from  ossessione  and de sica  s  i bambini ci guardano   both      up to   years later with fellini  antonioni  pasolini  . visconti makes an amazing directing dbut  taking the  uncredited  plot of  the postman always rings twice  as a guide to the development of his own themes .  br    br   it strikes us even today how ahead of its time  ossessione  was . shot in fascist italy during world war ii  think about it     it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters   and the fact that it used the plot of a famous american novel and payed no copyright didn  t help .  br    br    ossessione  alarmingly reveals poverty  ridden war  time italy  far from the idealized italy depicted in fascist  telefoni bianchi  movies   but it  s also extremely daring in its sexual frankness  with shirtless hunk gino  massimo girotti  who definitely precedes brando  s kowalski in  a streetcar named desire   taking giovanna  clara calamai   a married woman  to bed just  minutes after they first meet . we watch calamai  s unglamorous  matter  of  fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between gino and lo spagnolo  elio marcuzzo  a very appealing actor  his face not unlike pierre clmenti  s  who was shot by the nazis in      at   years old   . . . in a few words sex  lust  greed and poverty  as relentlessly as it had rarely  if ever  been shown before in italian cinema .  br    br   all the copies of  ossessione  were destroyed soon after its opening   it was called scandalous and immoral . visconti managed to save a print  and when the film was re  released after the war  most critics called it the front  runner of the neo  realist movement  preceding rossellini  s  roma citt aperta  and de sica  s  sciusci  . some other critics  perhaps more appropriately  saw  ossessione  as the italian counterpart to the  poetic realism  of french cinema  remember visconti had been renoir  s assistant   especially marcel carn  s  quai des brumes  and  le jour se lve   and julien duvivier  s  pp le moko  .  br    br   while  ossessione  may be neo  realistic in its visual language  the depiction of war  time paesan life in italy with its popular fairs  poverty  child labor  prostitution  bums  swindlers etc   the characters and the themes were already decidedly viscontian . he was always more interested in tragic  passionate  obsessive  greedy characters  in social  political  sexual apartheid  in the decadence of the elites than in realistic   everyday  life  characters and themes  favored by desica and rossellini . in  ossessione  we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films  especially  senso   visconti  s definitive departure from neo  realist aesthetics  and  rocco e suoi fratelli  . . . even in his most  neo  realist  film   la terra trema   he makes his fishermen rise from day  to  day characters to mythological figures .  br    br    ossessione  is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches  analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again  from their first to their last opus  no matter if the scenery  background or time  setting may change   visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are  well  obsessively recurrent .  ossessione  is not to be missed you  ll surely be fascinated by this ground  breaking  powerful film .  \n",

      "i am normally not compelled to write a review for a film  but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair  so i feel it necessary to share my point of view .  br    br    krisana   or as it was titled at the theater i saw it   fallen   follows matiss  a lonely latvian archivist  as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn  t try to stop from jumping off a bridge  as well as her reasons for doing so . that  s the plot in a nutshell  but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act . as a detective who investigates the incident tells him  we usually don  t bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die .  br    br   comparisons to michaelango antonioni and his  blowup  will most likely abound in any review you read about  krisana .  the influence of antonioni  s philosophical and austere style and the story of  blowup  are clear and  in fact  writer  director fred kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge  or at least who he thinks did .  br    br   the only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the  college film class  look and sound of the film . he or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist latvian film most likely faces  but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of matiss . the background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a fellini film  whether or not that was kelemen  s intention . the filmmakers undoubtedly had little money  but this constraint is used to the film  s advantage .  br    br    krisana  succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self  serious . it could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story  but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt . if you are more concerned with plot  this film and its ending may frustrate you . otherwise  take the time to be engaged by it . it is well  worth seeking out .  \n",

chikatilo case translates rather well  thanks to a westernized friendship between two rostov cops who become equals .  br    br   citizenx may also argue against    the death penalty far better than kevin spacey  s the life of david gayle       .  br    br   humans are machiavellian mammals  under which lie limbic brains  lizard  logic  . why did two kids  who knew better  stone to death a toddler they kidnapped  why do bloodthirsty women yell li  lilililililii  at acts of obscene terrorism   my own term for this is limbic domination   the lizard  logic urge to dominate an enemy  . if you have the words enemy   vengeance  in your vocabulary  you  re easily capable of limbic domination  .  br    br   in wwii  devastated     s rostov  located at the mouth of the don river near the black sea   nothing suppressed andrei chikatilo  s urge for limbic domination  from overpowering his layers of civilization . chikatilo  jeffrey demunn   s easy victims were paupers  usually children  who rode the interurban train for fun  since they couldn  t afford anything else .  br    br   citizenx reminds us that the denials of a rampant soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of   such lambs  . rostov  s serial killer roamed free for almost  years after the police arrested and let him go .  br    br   the politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere . although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world  in the west  vote  grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter  agency rivalries  stymieing a more coordinated response to crime . in the soviet union of citizenx  however  viktor burakov  stephen rea   s killer department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy .  br    br   geoffrey demunn plays the psychosexually inadequate chikatilo with faultless but understated authority   to the point of complete obscurity . in real life  too  chikatilo had a lifetime  s experience blending in and evading capture .  br    br   his pursuer  on the other hand  sticks out as a strange bird  given to unheralded  naive outbursts . perhaps by design  stephen rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief burakov . rea  s russian accent is impenetrable and his burakov is humourless and sullen  at odds with everyone .  br    br   so it  s donald sutherland who walks away with the picture . sutherland  s col . fetisov  burakov  s boss  and at first his only supporter  is an overly restrained  patient militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations . his reawakening as a logic  driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film  s cornerstone idealism .  br    br   joss ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik  secretary of communist ideology bondarchuk  overseeing the investigation . naturally  he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect  a communist  in      a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag  supposedly going home andrei chikatilo .  br    br   soon  he replaced burakov with another moscow apparatchik  detective gorbunov  john wood   insisting that the investigation now focus on known homosexuals  . the funniest scene of this sad  sad film comes during bondarchuk  s  gorbunov  s institutionalized harassment one stupid cop earnestly reports  as i suspected  comrade  it  s fornication . i  ve made some drawings    cue howling laughter .  br    br    yrs after the bodies began piling up  in      the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles . the only cooperating soviet psychiatrist was dr aleksandr bukhanovsky  max von sydow   who termed the unsub citizenx  . he later also observed to fetisov  burakov that  . . . together you make a wonderful person  . we concur .  br    br   the drawn  out pace  spread over a decade  perfectly captures the institutional inertia of glasnost   openness    that wasn  t . the contrast with perestroika   restructuring    couldn  t  ve been greater for the case . although chikatilo was still prowling railway stations  police plans were about to bear fruit .  br    br   in      col . fetisov was expeditiously promoted to general . his nemesis bondarchuk disappeared off the scene  allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference . staff  communications  publicity   suddenly all were available . in just one night of telephoning around  fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the fbi  s serial murder task force at quantico  where  fetisov discovered  staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators .  br    br   fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief  now colonel  burakov  of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie  s powerhouse watershed scene . fetisov  s is the most tender apology i  ve ever seen on film privately  i offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife . i hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance   he almost whispers .  br    br   a hbo production  citizenx is a film of the highest caliber . not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak  shot exclusively in the most run  down parts of otherwise spectacular budapest   but randy edelman  s soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming   and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality . those who speak hungarian will recognize the many hungarian accents and credits .  br    br   chikatilo  s actual murders are depicted as bleak  aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an

guarantee society  s failure to learn from the complex reality of victims  deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of how  why they died . nor do killers learn regret if they  re dead .  br    br   vengeance doesn  t unkill victims . baying for the killer  s blood constitutes nothing better than counter  domination   once it  s too late .  br    br   vengeance on behalf of the grieving isn

      "  citizen x  is the superbly told true story of the hunt for one of history  s worst serial killers . what makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place the soviet union in the      s .  br    br    mild spoilers   br    br   viktor burakov  magnificently played by stephen rea  is a newly promoted forensic investigator for the rostov oblast militia . he discovers past and present unsolved murders  apparently by the same person . the murders are unsolved because no one has ever taken the trouble to properly investigate the evidence . he is driven to find and stop the killer . his only tools are his dedication  skill and honesty . his obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the soviet system that discourages the search for truth . his naivet would have led to failure were it not for his boss  col . mikhail fetisov  donald sutherland  . fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the soviet bureaucracy . however  he also shares burakov  s desire to bring a murderer to justice  even if the official party line is  there are no serial killers in the soviet union    br    br   the cast is outstanding . the locations and sets are perfect recreations of latter day soviet life . randy edelman  s score is particularly good .  br    br   more important  this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy . this was a made  for  cable movie by hbo films and they have become a great resource for films that would otherwise never be made .  \n",
      "the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a  instead of a   . that could have been so much better  this movie deserves it .  br    br   this is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously . if you do not like movies about serial killers  but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former sovjet union  this movie is a must  see anyway .  br    br   i can  t compare it to  silence of the lambs  for several reasons . the way the serial killer is portrayed  has been done far much better in citizen x . you see several details of his private life  because you  travel  along with the killer  which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration .  br    br   the only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was  henry  portrait of a serial killer  . if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x .  \n",
      "citizen x tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed  the rostov ripper  this great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer . the film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over   years .  possibly over   victims  mostly women and children  the performances of stephen rea as the lead detective and donald sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb . jeffrey demunn as the ripper andrei romanovich chikatilo . this is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case . this a film not to be missed . it debuted i believe on hbo and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding . great film  \n",
      "i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out  and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun . this is a great cast of characters  many big names in it  a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now . i think it  s a great idea if you follow any of these actors  or have loved them in other movies  to add it to your watched list . some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well  done comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue  kind of odd spontaneous  appearing comedy  with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors . the movie did a great job at giving you some insight  perhaps even very realistic  into the culture of a daytime soap .  \n",
      "chris gerolmo took care not to simply give us a jack  the  stripper  type of list of murdered people he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results . perhaps mostly due to stephen rea  s excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both . it was the playing of these two parts  above all  which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of rostov . supporting actors  especially max von sydow  carried out their parts really well . good directing . the photography was good too . needless to say  the fact that the film was shot in hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations  but  frankly  given the depth of the story  telling and interpretations  we can completely forget these little trivialia .  br    br   for once  a made for tv film from hbo has come up trumps . recommended  especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes  which  i hasten to add  are never exaggerated .  \n",
      "though i saw this movie years ago  its impact has never left me . stephen rea  s depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving . his anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable . everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts  to the troubled citizen x . each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers  i think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers .  \n",
      "i believe this is the most powerful film hbo pictures has made to date . this film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen . it is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out . chris gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay . the performances from stephen rea  donald sutherland and jeffery demunn are flawless . a masterpiece of the genre .  \n",
      "imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends  year  s of his life  and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself  the murder technique is clear  but a government unwilling to admit the truth let  s a monster destroy dozens of lives . when i think my job is stressful  i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick . the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea . the comic  and almost tragic at times  relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last  years . the catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat . while not nearly as well advertised and talked about as  silence of the lamb  s   the plot was just as suspenseful . rent or buy this movie today   \n",
      "rea  sutherland  demunn  and von sydow  in a small role  are all brilliant in their performances . sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role  where he must portray a character whose morality is  at first  uncertain to the audience . as is so often the case with sutherland  s characters  we must ask  is he a villian in this case  a minor one  or a hero    br    br   this is a disturbing story  intelligently told  about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the old soviet union that impeded the efforts of extremely competent people . as sutherland  s character wryly notes   the measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions  . the  committee meeting   between rea and sutherland  s characters  after perestroika is enforced  with its revelations  has enormous emotional impact . you can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system .  br    br   the handful of dramatic scenes portraying victims  family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story . this is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter  but effectively reminds us that the victims had lives  and were loved .  br    br   this is a sad  but very important film  which deserved its showcase on canada  s history television .  \n",
      "okay  let  s start off by saying this film is not an exact rendition of the crimes and legal pursuit of andrei chikatilo . while it may have been  official policy  in the politburo that the ussr had no serial killers  in actuality the legal system had handled others  and  killer x   as he was actually called  was already being sought when fetisov brought burakov onto the case . in fact  as soon as it was realized they had multiple murders on their hands  the authorities assigned a task force of dozens of officers to track down and end the killing spree of a man that did not fit into what is perceived as normal serial killer parameters . it  s good the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is only  based upon actual events   for a docudrama this ain  t .  br    br   spoilers follow  br    br   that said  this is a damn good example of a fast  paced hollywood  style thriller that still gets across the basics of what happened . it is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing . yes  chikatilo raped and murdered both children and adults  both male and female . yes  shoddy lab  work set him free to continue killing for years . yes  innocent men were accused of the murders and  confessed  to their crimes at police urging . yes  the gay community was harassed while the crimes were being committed  albeit with burakov  s committed assistance  . and yes  chikatilo was brought to confession not by the haranguing of the special prosecutor  gorbunov  but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named bukhanovsky  though gorbunov was really nowhere near the egotistical martinet portrayed in this film  . quibbles about truth and veracity aside  all of these events are dramatized in a manner that consistently tightens the tension and fear .  br    br   it doesn  t hurt that director and co  writer chris gerolmo has a pitch perfect cast . stephen rea  s growing emotional involvement in the killings and developing expertise in detecting clues  donald sutherland  s snarky manipulation of the soviet party hacks and subtle spine that becomes evident when it is needed  jeffrey demunn  s seething undercurrent of rage hidden by a fear  filled demeanor  max von sydow  s boyish excitement at being part of a criminal investigation all enhance the sharp dialog and crisp editing in ways that cannot be underestimated .  br    br   taken for what it is   citizen x  is almost pitch perfect  the  almost  due to one moment of self  congratulation at the end that just does not fit  . highly recommended as fiction well  told  not fact being presented . . . but considering the junky  serial killer  movies that hollywood usually spits out  that  s good enough for me .  \n",

      "caution may contain spoilers . . .  br    br   i  ve seen this movie  times  i  ve liked it every time . upon seeing it again  i  m always reminded of how good it is . an hbo tv movie  very well done like most of their movies are  this would  ve gotten oscars for it  s performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tv .  br    br   as i  m sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here  this is the story of serial murderer  andrei chikatilo . he murdered   people over  years in the former soviet union .   victims were buried  couldn  t be found so he was only convicted of   out of   of his murders .  the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst  victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea . a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks  his part is essential to be sure . there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america  investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after   months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain  frustration . according to this acct  burakov worked for over  years before getting his first break from it . he followed the case to its conclusion   years later . in this scene  his superior  general fetisov  played by donald sutherland  actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should  ve given him a break sooner .  br    br   rea  s performance is so well done  he doesn  t overact  chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer . he is a man with passion  but doesn  t show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies . he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances . rea does so much with his face  his eyes  he doesn  t need to overact . he just is  his character  so frustrated after so long  at one point  driven to frustration  he actually says he  d rather find  at one time than none in a year . of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die  he just wants some clues to catch this man . rea makes us feel for this man . he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility .  br    br   a mutant to be sure  chikatilo  s childhood was one which produces such  monsters .  the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn . he somehow  impossible though it may seem  elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself . perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong  either way  his performance is very well done .  br    br   donald sutherland as colonel fetisov  later promoted to general  also does a great job . he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn  t seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov . but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant  he actually actively participates in helping burakov . there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for .  br    br   although this movie deals with a morbid  grotesque and violent story  it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself . all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay . the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events  place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people behind the facts .  br    br    out of   stars  \n",

      "i remember following the case of andre chicatillo in the newspapers while i was living in south africa . they had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court . not  as it turned out  to protect the court members  but to protect him from the public . this was fascinating  albeit morbid  reading . i later heard that a film had been made by hbo about the case  but it was made for american tv . bummed  strangely  citizen x got a limited cinematic release in south africa . i charged down to the local ster kinekor complex and duly bought a ticket  i was alone my girlfriend at the time was only interested in the likes of steel magnolias and fried green tomatoes  . wow  what a brilliant film . why wasn  t it released to a wider audience  had it not been made for tv  it could have got an oscar nomination or  . there is no way to spoil the ending who the killer is is never kept from the audience . jeffrey demunn portrays a truly terrifying psycho . he is calm  downtrodden  considered a failure by his wife and subjected to constant ridicule and humiliation by his superiors at work . by committing these horrendous acts  he gets to feel strong  powerful .  br    br   fighting to catch him against all odds is a pathologist  played to excellent turn by stephen rea  in one of his strongest performances . he must battle the snail  pace of russian bureaucracy  the primitive resources he has at his disposal and  above all  the refusal by his superiors to acknowledge that the ussr even has a serial killer . the general in charge  joss ackland  says that serial killers are  a decadent  western phenomenon  . only donald sutherland is willing to help  but his help must be under the counter . the ever  brilliant max von sydow plays a russian psychiatrist who breaks protocol and decides to help the investigators in their quest . it is the first time in russian history that a shrink is used to build a profile of a serial killer still on the loose  and he has everything to lose if his involvement is made public .  br    br   citizen x is brilliantly acted  well written and the music and editing only add to the tension and theme of the film . excellent support from a horribly underused imelda staunton and a real sense of impending doom make citizen x a film worth seeing . this was too good to be made for tv  \n",
      "blood castle  aka scream of the demon lover  altar of blood  ivanna   the best  but least exploitation cinema  sounding title  and so on  is a very traditional gothic romance film . that means that it has big  creepy castles  a headstrong young woman  a mysterious older man  hints of horror and the supernatural  and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term . it also means that it is very deliberately paced  and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement . if you love films like robert wise  s the haunting        but you also have a taste for late     s  early     s spanish and italian horror  you may love blood castle  as well .  br    br   baron janos dalmar  carlos quiney  lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional  unspecified european village . the locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman  she soon after ends up dead   the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them . this is quite a problem because the baron has a very healthy appetite for women . at the beginning of the film  yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated .  br    br   meanwhile  dr . ivanna rakowsky  erna schrer  has appeared in the center of the village  asking to be taken to baron dalmar  s castle . she  s an out  of  towner who has been hired by the baron for her expertise in chemistry . of course  no one wants to go near the castle . finally  ivanna finds a shady individual  who becomes even shadier  to take her . once there  an odd woman who lives in the castle  olga  cristiana galloni   rejects ivanna and says that she shouldn  t be there since she  s a woman . baron dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay . she ends up staying  but somewhat reluctantly . the baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns  which the baron  s brother  igor  is suffering from .  br    br   unfortunately  the baron  s brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre  blackish liquid . and furthermore  ivanna is having bizarre  hallucinatory dreams . just what is going on at the castle  is the baron responsible for the crimes  is he insane   br    br   i wanted to like blood castle more than i did . as i mentioned  the film is very deliberate in its pacing  and most of it is very understated . i can go either way on material like that . i don  t care for the haunting  yes  i  m in a very small minority there   but i  m a big fan of     s and     s european horror . one of my favorite directors is mario bava . i also love dario argento  s work from that period . but occasionally  blood castle moved a bit too slow for me at times . there are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle .  br    br   but the atmosphere of the film is decent . director jos luis merino managed more than passable sets and locations  and they  re shot fairly well by emanuele di cola . however  blood castle feels relatively low budget  and this is a roger corman  produced film  after all  which usually means a low  budget  though often surprisingly high quality  quickie   . so while there is a hint of the lushness of bava  s colors and complex set decoration  everything is much more minimalist . of course  it doesn  t help that the retromedia print i watched looks like a    year old photograph that  s been left out in the sun too long . it appears  washed out   with compromised contrast .  br    br   still  merino and di cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals . for example  a scene of ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that  s shot from an exaggerated angle  and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only . there are also a couple ingmar bergmanesque shots  where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships  besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame .  br    br   the performances are fairly good  and the women   especially schrer   are very attractive . merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity . schrer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres  with english titles such as sex life in a woman  s prison        naked and lustful        strip nude for your killer       and erotic exploits of a sexy seducer       . blood castle is much tamer  but in addition to the nudity  there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage  and of course the scenes mixing sex and death .  br    br   the primary attraction here  though  is probably the story  which is much a slow  burning romance as anything else . the horror elements  the mystery elements  and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses  but in the end  blood castle is a love story  about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms  often with physical threats or harms  to be together .  \n",

      "the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end  where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters . kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris  so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy  gershwin tunes  and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant . kelly was at his best here  it  s a little different to singin  in the rain  and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor . no wonder the sequence ended  that  s entertainment  after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by   \n",
      "what makes for best picture material  the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly  and ignoring the  auteurs  who would be deified in decades to come . it wasn  t because hollywood was against art or creativity . the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself  and that is why  at least in the classic era  they tended to reward the greatest collaborations  the most sensational meetings of creative minds .  br    br   the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar  winning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before freed  aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business  would land a best picture . freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else  crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the   s musicals . the point about freed musicals  is that the lyrics of the songs  unlike those of hammerstein or lerner  don  t have to tell or even relate to the stories . what  s important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film .  br    br   an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals  the other two being singin  in the rain and the band wagon  which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story . the words don  t fit the plot  but the routines fit the show . so  when gene kelly sings i got rhythm  he hasn  t even got a girl yet  but the way it  s done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation  and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point . an american in paris also uses the rule  breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story  such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie caron  s character .  br    br   and what better director for this project than minnelli  himself a painter and a pianist  at this time there wasn  t really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor . while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades  minnelli  s colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced . in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted  but not drab  and in particular there is an absence of red . during oscar levant and georges guetary  s meeting in the caf  a few more vibrant shades are introduced . then  during the first musical number   by strauss  minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red  a table cloth  a bunch of roses  until it eventually dominates  as if the song has awoken the picture  s colour scheme . for most of the songs  the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people . however  in some numbers  such as  tra  la  la  he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated .  br    br   the achilles  heel of an american in paris is its story . i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable  playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the   s the headstrong  independent woman gets rejected while the meek  delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero . even if you don  t mind that  it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances . compare this to singin  in the rain  which doesn  t really have as many great routines or memorable set  pieces as an american in paris  but it has a winning storyline . singin  in the rain was overlooked at the     oscars  yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today . but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all  encompassing form of visual entertainment  not just a means of telling a story . an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear  jerking but  like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year  it certainly is a great show .  \n",

      " . . . oxford  mississippi  at least . okay  the paris we get is paris  culver city apart from the establishing library footage of the real mccoy but it is paris in spirit than which nothing  nowhere  is better . okay  kelly is no astaire but then who is and caron is no hepburn  ditto but alan lerner is light years ahead of the vastly overrated comden and green who scripted kelly  s other  big    s musical singin  in the rain  a curious replication of lyricists writing screenplays featuring songs by other lyricists and just to balance things the gershwin numbers are far superior to the arthur freed  nacio herb brown numbers so alan lerner didn  t have to feel too outclassed  . the story needn  t detain us any more than the anomalies  kelly hasn  t got change of a match and is a painter  i . e . bohemian  yet he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit at a few hours notice when foch invites him to dinner at her hotel in the well  documented love is here to stay sequence the lovers are strangely unmolested by passers  by  other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic  this is  after all  a feelgood musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case it stands four square . as feel good musicals go it  s definitely in the top   .  \n",

      "an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly . watch as gene sings  acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations . some purely majestic  others pure corn . one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before  singin  in the rain  . he is definately one of the all time greats . it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films  especially in kelly  s characters  the only main difference being that one is based in paris  the other in l . a .  br    br   some have said that leslie caron  s acting was less than pure . perhaps cyd charisse  who was originally intended for the role could have done better  however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly . oscar levant  s short role in this film gave it just what it needed  someone who doesn  t look like gene kelly . filling the role as the everyman isn  t an easy task  yet levant did it with as much class as any other lead .  br    br   the song and dance routines are all perfection . even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without . seeing that there really wasn  t much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable  minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you  d spent four hours with them . ingenious   br    br   i would have to rate this film up with singin  since it is very similar in story and song . singin  would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performance .  br    br   full recommendation .  br    br       stars .  \n",

      "uggh  i really wasn  t that impressed by this film  though i must admit that it is technically well made . it does get a  for very high production values  but as for entertainment values  it is rather poor . in fact  i consider this one of the most overrated films of the   s . it won the oscar for best picture  but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing . that  s because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting  such as meet me in st . louis   this movie is almost all singing and dancing . in fact  this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you aren  t into this  the film will quickly bore you . give me more story  as a result  with overblown production numbers and a weak story  this film is like a steady diet of meringue   it just doesn  t satisfy in the long run .  br    br   to think . . . this is the film that beat out  a streetcar named desire  and  a place in the sun  for best picture  and  to make matters worse   the african queen  and  ace in the hole  weren  t even nominated in this category  even more amazing to me is that  ace in the hole  lost for best writing  screenplay to this film   even though  an american in paris  had hardly any story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song .  \n",
      "while the story is sweet  and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy  the uniqueness of the film  and what makes it a masterpiece  is the dream sequence . it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music  gershwin   the engaging beauty of french impressionistic art  kelly  s enthralling choreography  including his rapturous  pas de deux d  amour   really a separate genre   with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set . matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist .  \n",
      "i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites . it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli . it won two academy awards for best picture of     and best screenplay . the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big . nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him  but soon finds she loves the guy . meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel  leslie caron . his main dancing partner  and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise . famous french singer georges guietary sings  too . so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levant  s nimble piano fingers  the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem .      \n",

      "timeless musical gem  with gene kelly in top form  stylish direction by vincente minnelli  and wonderful musical numbers . it is great entertainment from start to finish  one of those films that people watch with a smile and say  they don  t make  em like they used to   but they never did quite make them like this . the climactic   minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history . movie magic  clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved . a must see   \n",
      "i enjoyed this film . it was lighthearted  delightful  and very colorful . you can see that mgm was showing off technicolor . there are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film . every scene is packed full . the choreography was great . gene kelly is a wonder . he is so talented . the dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed  and perfectly designed . he understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else . the last section of the film  the grand dance sequence  is very impressive . what makes this film very special is gershwin  s music . few american composers have had a better gift for melody . i very much enjoy gershwin  s music . it is enchanting . ira gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers . he is so witty and charming . this was a highly entertaining film .  \n",
      "okay  so the plot is on shaky ground . yeah  all right  so there are some randomly inserted song and  or dance sequences  for example adam  s concert and henri  s stage act  . and leslie caron can  t really  um  you know . . . act .  br    br   but somehow   an american in paris  manages to come through it all as a polished  first  rate musical   largely on the basis of gene kelly  s incredible dancing talent and choreography  and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with caron .  he needs to  because she seems to have a . . . problem with emoting .   br    br   the most accomplished and technically awe  inspiring number in this musical is obviously the    minute ballet towards the end of the film . it  s stunningly filmed  and kelly and caron dance beautifully . but my favourite number would have to be kelly  s character singing  i got rhythm  with a bunch of french school  children  then breaking into an array of american dances . it just goes to prove how you don  t need special effects when you  ve got some real talent .  br    br   not on the  classics  level with  singin  in the rain   but pretty high up there nonetheless . worth the watch   \n",
      "there are few comedies like this  where almost every line and every character come close to flawless . this is soooo funny   and it has quite a bit of satire there to . sally field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good  if not perfect  job with her daytime tv  diva . sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top  but    of the time she is a riot  in the same league is kevin kline  robert downey jr and whoopy goldberg  who unfortunately has too little to do here  . downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time  but he struggles with his part which is  to be honest  the most ungrateful one . but the shining star here is cathy moriarty as celeste  a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret  you will see in the absolutely stunning finale   . sadly elisabeth shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part . i normally like ms shue  but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie . but it is not something damaging and for the most part she is at least adequate . otherwise  brimming with memorable lines and situations  this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on tv or wherever .  \n",

      "i felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film  s page because some of it was slightly misinformative .  br    br   originally i posted quotes from the original poster  but i wasn  t sure if it was proper given that this is the  comments  index and not a message board  though we used to use  em that way back before imdb added the film message boards  so i will edit this to make it unnecessary .  br    br   well  first of all you may not be aware of this  but gene kelly first became famous for playing  pal joey  on broadway in the original production . when vincente minnelli decided to make a gershwin  panorama  film  he wanted kelly  s character to be more sophisticated than the  goody two shoes  roles he had been playing in most his films  with the exception of  for me and my gal   . alan jay lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in paris based on the story of  pal joey  . this gave kelly a chance to play his famous role from broadway even though warners had outbid mgm for the rights to  pal joey .  in my opinion  the wb film  pal joey  is a wreck  though sinatra was suitable for the role  but other problems sunk the film  script changes and poor direction .   br    br   you complain that kelly  s pictures are not well done  even citing your art education to prove the point . but you miss the fact that kelly  s bad art was clearly designed to be bad  and it is necessary for the story  characters . the pictures are so bad  the audience knows that kelly isn  t ready for an exhibition . even he knows it  though milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her . but it  s important that the audience not be sitting there saying  but  he  s a great artist  if he only had the chance   . you want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies .  br    br   then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show again you are not understanding the structure of the story . he refuses because he doesn  t want to feel like a gigolo  and because he knows he  s not really ready for the exhibition . his enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as  joey  s  enthusiasm to  start a nightclub  . but it serves the same function in the plot . remember  it  s essential in  pal joey   the play  that joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesn  t deserve it . same with the art show . if kelly  s paintings were actually good  it would undermine this whole point .   br    br   then you complain that caron and kelly have no  chemistry  . i guess it  s in the eye of the beholder . i agree  the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be  but for me it was fine . compare it to even worse  forced  romances like the one between cary grant and sophia loren in  the pride and the passion  .   br    br   when you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film  it just shows that you haven  t dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism . many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters  and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism . it  s about finding love  enjoying love  then losing love  he looks around and his love is gone  . the movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships . if you didn  t  see that  it  s not the movie  s fault . it  s certainly not a  load of crap  .   \n",
      "an american in paris was  in many ways  the ultimate mixture of art and hollywood musical . made at the height of mgm  s powers as a musical powerhouse  the film features memorable music from the gershwins  who rightly have been called the   th century  s equivalent of beethoven and mozart .  br    br   gene kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film  though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm  up for his best work in singin  in the rain       . the two films are actually closely linked . aside from the arthur freed connection  the broadway melody segment in  rain  owes its existence to the incredible american in paris ballet sequence in this film . this might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film . and it deserved to be  as it showcases gene kelly  s skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree .  br    br   the film  s cast is uniformly excellent . leslie caron  incredibly making her film debut  shows a maturity that makes you think she  d been making films for years . her introductory dance sequence  and later her work on the ballet  provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in mgm musicals only by cyd charisse  s work in singin  in the rain and the band wagon . oscar levant is hilarious as kelly  s stoic pal  who gets two of the film  s best moments during the end party sequence  which i will not give away for anyone who hasn  t seen the film   and one of the film  s most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state  of  the  art  for the time  special effects .  br    br   less memorable are georges guetary as kelly  s romantic rival  though he does get a few musical highlights  and nina foch as leslie caron  s romantic rival . the may  december relationship between kelly  s character and nina  s reminded me of the same  kept man  relationship seen between george peppard and patricia neal in breakfast at tiffany  s .  br    br   there are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than singin  in the rain . the ballet  though lavish and well  produced  doesn  t really fit with the rest of the movie . without giving away the plot  the ballet just happens  with no real rhyme or reason . and unlike the broadway melody sequence  it really doesn  t have anything to do with the plot   and in the best musicals  the songs always have some sort of raison d  etre .  br    br   making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the ballet . although the ending shouldn  t be a surprise  this is an mgm musical  after all   i was hoping for a bit more . . . movie after the ballet ended . it  s as if director vincente minnelli felt that he couldn  t follow the ballet with anything else . the film literally left me in the lurch .  br    br   that negative aside  an american in paris rightly ranks alongside the best of hollywood  s musicals . it doesn  t quite reach the heights of singin  in the rain  but it comes close and it remains a testament to gene kelly  s skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time .  \n",

      "gene kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with mgm . here he  s at the top of his creative powers working with the arthur freed musical unit . hard to believe when you watch an american in paris that the players never left the back lot at mgm .  br    br   the magic of an american in paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of vincent minnelli and the sets that mgm designed blended with some background establishing shots . the idea of the film originated with kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving george gershwin  s tone poem an american in paris . it sounded good to arthur freed who approached ira gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other gershwin material .  br    br   gershwin got the kind of deal for gershwin music that irving berlin normally got . not one note of non  gershwin music is heard in an american in paris . listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like embraceable you and but not for me which are not real musical numbers .  br    br   another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics  alan jay lerner  wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one . all about an ex  gi played by gene kelly who after world war ii never left france  just settled into an apartment on the left bank and proceeded to become a starving artist . he lives with eccentric composer oscar levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy .  br    br   two women are interested in him . another expatriate american played by nina foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he  ll reciprocate in other matters . but kelly falls for a shop girl played by leslie caron in her film debut . caron also has musical comedy star georges guetary interested in here .  br    br   of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of george gershwin . an american in paris happens to be the first film i ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip i ever took . i still remember flying back from phoenix arizona to kennedy airport seeing gene kelly doing i  ve got rhythm . my favorite number in the film however is tra  la  la which kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with oscar levant playing the piano . at one point kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano .  br    br   in a book about arthur freed  i read a quote where he said in the american in paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the french impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot . so it happened that way . kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in words and music  the pirate  and on the town . but this one topped them all . still does in my opinion and that includes some of gene kelly  s later films .  br    br   in a surprise upset at the oscars  an american in paris was chosen best picture for      beating out the heavily favored a streetcar named desire . i guess fantasy trumped realism that year . big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well .  br    br   still an american in paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof  something less likely to be repeated .  \n",

      "parsifal       starring michael kutter  armin jordan  robert lloyd  martin sperr  edith clever  aage haugland and the voices of reiner goldberg  yvonne minton  wolfgang schone  director hans  jurgen syberberg .  br    br   straight out of the german school of film  the kind that favored tons of symbolism and ingmar bergmanesque surrealism  came this     film of wagner  s final masterpiece  parsifal  written to correspond with good friday  easter and the consecration of the bayreuth opera house . this film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avant  garde and no other parsifal takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography . syberberg is known for controversial films . prior to this film he had released films about hitler and nazism  richard wagner and his personal anti  semitism and a documentary about winifred wagner  one of his grand  daughters . this film is possibly disturbing in many aspects . parsifal  sung by reiner goldberg but acted by michael kutter  is a male throughout the first part of the film and then  after the enchantment of kundry  s kiss  is transformed into a female . this gender  bending element displays the feminine  masculine  ying  yang nature of the quest for the holy grail  which serves all mankind and redeems it through christ  s blood . in the pagan sorcerer klingsor  s fortress  there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as hitler  nietzche  cosima wagner and wagner  s mistress matilde wesendock . the swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress . parsifal journeys into the   th and   th century throughout the film . the tempting flower maidens are in the nude . kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt mary magdalene or eve from genesis  played by edith clever but beautifully sung by mezzo  soprano yvonne minton  . ultimately  this film is for fans of this type of bizarre germanic  european symbolic metafiction and for intellectuals who appreciate the symbolism  the history and lovers of wagner opera . indeed  the singing is grand and compelling . reiner goldberg  s parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater parsifals of the stage  james king  wolfgang windgassen  rene kollo and today  s own placido domingo . yvone minton is a sensual  voiced  dramatic and exciting kundry  delving into her tormented state perfectly . while the production is certainly unorthodox and as un  wagnerian as it can possibly get  wagner  s concept was christian ceremonial pomp with grails  spears  castles  knights and wounded kings  a dark sorcerer  darkness turning into light  etc typical wagnerian themes  . . it is still an enjoyable  art  house film .  \n",
      "this very peculiar setting of wagner  s last opera definitely grew on me . when i first saw it  i was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images  and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story . however  if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherch  gimmicks   i think you will find that the film does manage to capture the very strange  other  worldly atmosphere of the opera  and that there are moments which are particularly fine .  br    br   personally  i never really understood the role of kundry until i saw how edith clever portrayed her . her performance  a lip  synchronized mime of the singing voice of yvonne minton  is nothing short of dazzling  from end to end  and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film .  br    br   another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of robert lloyd of the crucial role of gurnemanz  one which lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world . i have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of gurnemanz on the stage of the metropolitan opera several times  and the lusciousness of his voice  and the warm  fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved  as did his performance in the character  s two major monologues  the karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in act  .  br    br   the version i have seen was a videotape made for america  and so there were subtitles which  alas  could not be done away with . this is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera . this seemed to me to be quite contrary both to wagner  s clear avoidance of christianity  and his very deliberate attempt to  generalize  the christian elements of the story .  see footnote with spoiler at the end of this review .  i find it nearly impossible  when viewing a film with subtitles  to keep from absorbing them  and strongly recommend that  if in the dvd versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off  you do so  and instead  if the opera is unfamiliar to you  that you read the libretto carefully beforehand .  br    br   the bottom line is that there is much in the film which i dislike  and would just as soon have seen done differently . . . but it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since i first saw it  and i find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again .  br    br                                                                      br    br   footnote containing a spoiler a good example would be kundry  s famous line   i saw him . . . him . . . and laughed .  this gets translated  in the subtitles  for reasons which escape me  as  i saw the savior  s face .  it is especially irritating to me  because throughout the libretto  wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character who need not be the biblical jesus as  der heiland   i . e .  the german for  the healer    a reference to the wound of amfortas  and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing .  \n",
      "updated january  st       br    br   parsifal is one of my two favorite wagner operas or music dramas  to be more accurate   meistersinger is the other .  though it  s hard to imagine it as the  top of anyone  s pops  . the libretto  by the composer as usual  is a muddle of religion  paganism  eroticism  and possibly even homo  eroticism  and its length may make it seem to the audience like hearing paint dry .  br    br   wagner  being a famous anti  semite   klingsor may be one of his surrogate jewish villains .  naturally entrusted the premiere to an unconverted  not for want of rw  s trying   hermann levi  who was his favorite conductor   go figure   kundry  a most mixed  up  gal and another likely jewish surrogate  is both villainous or benevolent  depending on the scene .  br    br   considering that many video versions of parsifal seem on the stodgy side  this film of the opera is  in comparison  a breath of fresh air . hans  jrgen syberberg  the director  has brought considerable imagination to it but it  s hard to know why he made some of his choices . for example the notorious dual parsifals  of each gender    the puppets  the death  mask  of  wagner set and various dolls and symbols such as the nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes .  if i remember  the  real  engelbert humperdinck wrote the actual music to pad out the scene changes .  though wagner himself died much too early to be an actual nazi  many of his descendants  as well as his second wife cosima .  were at least fellow  travelers  including their grandson wolfgang wagner who still runs the bayreuth festival at an advanced age . in fact  wolfgang  s son gottfried wagner  in complete opposition to his father  has tried to come to terms honestly with his great  grandfather .  br    br   syberberg  too  seems politically ambiguous from what i  ve read . in      he made a well  known film on hitler   hitler ein film aus deutschland   sometimes called  our hitler  in english .  . since it lasts all of  hours and hasn  t been widely distributed  most people have not seen it  including myself .  .  br    br   armin jordan  the conductor of the audio cd on which this film is based  plays amfortas  sung by wolfgang schne  edith clever  yvonne minton  plays kundry  michael kutter and karin krick play the dual parsifals  both sung by reiner goldberg .   and robert lloyd and aage haugland both play and sing gurnemanz and klingsor .  br    br   though the opera takes place over a long period of time and all  except kundry   have been described as having aged considerably between acts  and   no one looks a day older by the end of the opera .  the magic of the grail  in this opera the grail is the cup from which jesus drank at the last supper and not mary magdalene as in more recent times  an idea i find preposterous   .  br    br   the conducting and singing are all quite serviceable and the dvd seems to have improved the sound  if not the picture  to a great extent .  yes  i agree that  kna  s  approach is superior  even on the second  stereo  version but he is probably superior to all recorded versions on the whole .   br    br   not a parsifal for all wagnerites but i think it works quite well as a filmed opera .  \n",
      "etienne girardot is just a character actor   the sort of person people almost never would know by name . however  he once again plays the coroner   one of the only actors in the philo vance films that played his role more than once . i  ve already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air . this film also is great to watch because in addition to girardot  there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride   including grant mitchell  gene lockhart  henry walthal  kent smith  h . b . warner and nat pendleton . this is quite an impressive cast  and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce .  br    br   these great character actors are one of the big reasons i love these old b  movies . while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific  because of the breezy writing and acting  the films really satisfy . as for this film  vance is played wonderfully by lowe but  like i said  the mystery itself is only an after  thought   with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides . unfortunately  you cannot hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sort   i have training in clinical hypnosis and if i could do anything like the evil guy could do in the film  i would have done it  used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets    br    br   overall  while not the best philo vance film  it was very good and it  s a darn shame lowe only played this role once . in fact  aside from william powell  who played vance five times   the series was hindered by a long  long succession of actors such as basil rathbone  wilfred hyde  white and warren william  and many others  playing vance . this is a similar problem that also plagued the bulldog drummond series   just too many different actors playing the leading man .  br    br   well worth seeing and exciting   though also quite impossible .  \n",

      "claire denis  s chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film . the film presents a very interesting look at the household of a european colonial family living in cameroon  giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction . however  the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient . for example  a central theme in the story is young france  s inability to form strong relationships with others . although this portrayal is executed flawlessly  notably in the way that denis frames the story with scenes from france  s return to her childhood home  the girl  s lack of intimacy with the film  s other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development  or lack thereof  as a protagonist . the general stagnation of the film  s character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot . the film raises a great deal of tension between characters  particularly between aimee and the men in her life  but never fully addresses this social friction  leaving the viewer unsatisfied . the final few scenes are powerful but depressing . denis  s work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint  but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama  chocolat is definitely not the best choice .  \n",

      "i knew absolutely nothing about chocolat before my viewing of it . i didn  t know anything about the story  the cast  the director  or anything about the film  s history . all i knew was it was a highly  acclaimed french film . had i known more  i probably wouldn  t have viewed the picture with an open mind . on paper  the premise doesn  t sound interesting to me . had i known what chocolat was about ahead of time  my interest while watching would have been limited . however  not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it . throughout  i had no clue has to where the story would go  what the characters would do  and what the end result would be . it was  if nothing else  not a predictable film . indeed  it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks . telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers . since the lead character is seen in present day  the audience knows she will remain alive . by using the flashback technique  director claire denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage  giving the viewer the sense that chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside . a lesser filmmaker would give france a haggard  looking face  one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood . instead  denis presents france as a beautiful girl  someone who looks fine on the outside .  br    br   it could be argued that chocolat is more about france  s mother since she is given far more screen time  though i believe it is ultimately about france . to me  what chocolat is really about is how a mother  s actions affect her daughter . it is about how parents  behavior stays with their offspring . france is not ruined by her mother  s actions in the story  yet her mother  s actions clearly made an impression on france . had france not been affected at all by her mother  s actions  the flashback aspect would be irrelevant .  br    br   for a movie that deals with two time periods  the past and the present  chocolat was a very well paced  there were no scene of excess fat . none of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place . the film had nice rhythm  the editing crisp  leaving only what was necessary to tell the story . with a well told story  solid editing  and organized directing  chocolat is one of the better french films i have seen . it was responsible for launching claire denis  career and with good reason it  s an incredible directorial debut .  \n",
      "the story is about a little girl growing up in colonial africa  but it is so much more than that .  br    br   anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things . a longing for another  one of a different race  that cannot be consummated . even a glance is forbidden . there are no words needed . their facial expressions say everything .  br    br   it is the story of a black servant  prote  isaach de bankol  and a white woman  aime  giulia boschi  . their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other .  br    br   the little girl  france  ccile ducasse  is lonely and spends all her time with prote . she really can  t see this dance .  br    br   one of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials . they cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves . there world is about to end they just don  t know it yet . their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence .  br    br   i think i would like to visit this africa . it seems so quiet especially at night when you only hear the animals .  \n",
      "i think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial africa in the    s and    s rather than as a story . because there is no real story here . just one vignette on top of another like little points of light that don  t mean much until you have enough to paint a picture . the first time i saw chocolat i didn  t really  get it  until having thought about it for a few days . then i realized there were lots of things to  get   including the end of colonialism which was but around the corner  just no plot . anyway  it  s one of my all  time favorite movies . the scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry . if you like  exciting  movies  don  t watch this   you  ll be bored to tears . but  for some of you . . .  you can thank me later for recommending it to you .  \n",
      "i loved this film because in my mind it seemed to so perfectly capture what i imagined life in french colonial africa must have been like in the    s   my  generation anyway  . but i was truly enraptured by its quiet pacing and by the glorious ending . within the last  minutes of this film  you must focus intently on what  s happening . never have i been more impressed with the  wrap  up  of a film . i remember yelling  wow   when i realized it was over . on the other hand  my two daughters fell asleep on the couch    \n",
      "in reflecting on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective . one relatively forgettable but covering the same geography  is coup de torchon  the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable indochine . claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of indochine  the complex and unspoken relationship between france and her colonial subjects .  br    br   i was struck with the dignity of potee  with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses . i was also struck with the love  hate relationship between him and aimee . it is the latter that gives the film its driving force  it is the latter that links this movie to indochine .  br    br   one never is sure what motivates everyone  though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism . it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de torchon . theirs is the more scandalous story  perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way  but denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships .  br    br   the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa . he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother . he was coming home  but they just thought him to be a little daft . france  the character and the girl  grew up in cameroon  but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was .  br    br    \n",
      "this is an amazing film to watch or show young people . aside from a very brief nude scene  it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in africa that you  ll rarely find in other films . it does bear a superficial similarity to out of africa  but without all the romantic fluff . the white french people in cameroon are fascinating because they don  t even seem to regard the natives as people . the whites are all the bosses and they expect black servitude without question . however  unlike real servants  you only once hear any of the whites say  thank you  and no other regard is given these people . again and again  it  s like they are pets or slaves  as the feelings of the people are never even considered .  br    br   the central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother  aime and her servant  prote . although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other  the white woman never considers prote or the existence of his feelings . a good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has prote lace up her dress and it  s obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this . apart from this relationship  while almost all the whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the africans are people  a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage .  br    br   also interesting is the relationship between prote and the little girl  who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film  . while they are very close  at times he  s more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children .  br    br   there is one bizarre white character who seems  at times  to regard the blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing . one moment  he  s doing hard work along side the blacks or eating with them  something the other whites would never have done  and the next he  s trying to beat up prote  i could only guess as to what motivated him   perhaps he was just a jerk  or was crazy or perhaps was a communist agitator trying to stir up the blacks against the whites  who knows   . in fact  other than a few good scenes  this character seems pretty much wasted .  br    br   while i really enjoyed the insight this movie gave  i wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life . the context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more . the film appeared to begin in the early     s  since she  s wearing a walkman  style headset  and when the film went back in time  it seems that it was set about      more or less   but there was never any mention of the     s anti  colonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early     s . i am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and should have made the beginning of the film earlier  such as the     s  and had the lady think back to her life there in the early     s   before the country experienced political change .  br    br   apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods  using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea . and i also appreciated the ending  as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride . but overall  it just feels like something is missing   there just isn  t any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel .  \n",
      "till hbo began rerunning it this month . i remember laughing out loud in the theater back in      and now again in my living room . if i see that it  s on  i have to watch it . there  s just no question . this is so much more entertaining to me than other  more popular spoofs like airplane   which i really like  btw  . cathy moriarty steals the show in my opinion . quotes like  sudden speech  the last symptoms of brain fever  she could blow at any moment   put me over the edge . and whoopie goldberg hasn  t been this funny since  jumpin  jack flash  . kevin klein  sally field  robert downey jr . all turn in superb performances as expected . i started out giving this  out of   stars  but then i realized that for the type of film it  s supposed to be  there isn  t one thing i  d change or improve upon . so   it is . i have to get this on dvd  that  s just all there is to it .  \n",
      "unfortunately  because of us viewers  tendency to shun subtitles  this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits . its subtle themes of belonging  identity  racial relations and especially how colonialism harms all parties  transcend the obvious dramatic tensions  the nostalgic memories of the protaganiste  s childhood  and the exoticism of her relationship with her parents   houseboy   perhaps the only  real  human she knows . we won  t even look at her mother  s relationship with this elegant man . there  i hope i  ve given you enough of a hook to take it in  whether you speak french or like subtitles or not . i challenge you to be as brave  strong and aware as la p  tite .  \n",
      "my  rd  year french classes always enjoyed this film very much . in a multi  cultural  inner  city high school  the film provided many subjects for discussion  in french in class  but i know a lot of discussion went on in english after class  . the most obvious is the relationship between prote and aime compared to the one between prote and france .  br    br   i always mentioned that i felt this film had one of the  sexiest  scenes i had ever seen in a movie . one year  a    year  old african  american shouted   yes   when he figured out the scene the one where prote is helping aime lace up her evening dress  all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror . directors use the  mirror technique  when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene this is a perfect example of the technique  and it is  sexy  .  br    br   most students had trouble understanding the end of the film . one suggested that one theme of the movie was  africanism   and that no matter how much one loved africa or africans  one cannot  become  african  like the driver tried to do   one must be african .  \n",
      "set in the cameroons in west africa in the     s  claire denis  chocolat is a beautifully photographed and emotionally resonant tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying colonialism on a young family during the last years of french rule . the theme is similar to the recent nowhere in africa  though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis . the film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country . france dalens  mireille perrier   a young woman traveling through cameroon  recalls her childhood when her father  francois cluzet  was a government official in the french cameroons and she had a loving friendship with the brooding manservant  prote  isaach de bankol  . the heart of the film  however  revolves around france  s mother aime  giulia boschi  and her love  hate relationship with prote that is seething with unspoken sexual tension .  br    br   the household is divided into public and private spaces . the white families rooms are private and off limits to all except prote who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors  exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white family  s gazes . it becomes clear when her husband marc  franois cluzet  goes away on business that aime and prote are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged . in one telling sequence  she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each other  s image in the mirror with a defiant longing in their eyes  knowing that any interaction is taboo .  br    br   the young france  cecile ducasse  also forms a bond with the manservant  feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the nocturnal sky . in spite of their bond  the true nature of their master  servant relationship is apparent when france commands prote to interrupt his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home  and when prote stands beside her at the dinner table  waiting for her next command . when a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains  the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located . each visitor shows their disdain for the africans  one  a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings leftover food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room . another  luc  jean  claude adelin   an arrogant white frenchman  upsets the racial balance when he uses the outside shower  eats with the servants  and taunts aime about her attraction to prote leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the manservant .  br    br   chocolat is loosely autobiographical  adapted from the childhood memories of the director  and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed . denis makes her point about the effects of colonialism without preaching or romanticizing the characters . there are no victims or oppressors  no simplistic good guys . prote is a servant but he is also a protector as when he stands guard over the bed where aime and her daughter sleep to protect them from a rampaging hyena . it is a sad fact that prote is treated as a boy and not as a man  but bankol imbues his character with such dignity and stature that it lessens the pain . because of its pace  western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and denis does not  in roger ebert  s phrase   coach our emotions  . the truth of chocolat lies in the gestures and glances that touch the silent longing of our heart .  \n",
      "despite the patronage of george lucas  this captivating and totally original fantasy in  lumage   a combination of animation through live action cut  outs  is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by ralph bakshi in his heyday . brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape  shifting dog ralph  one of a duo of bumbling  rejected heroes   synonamess botch  the hilariously foul  mouthed villain  and rod rescueman  the pompous novice superhero  breathe life into a uniquely clever concept frivoli vs . murkwood or  the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares . in this context  the mor  infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do . it  s a real pity  therefore  that i have had to watch this via a truly crappy  looking boot  culled from a tv screening  of the uncensored version  there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its vhs release  since the film is otherwise unavailable on dvd . interestingly  both henry selick and david fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities .  \n",

      "way back in      the british made a comedy called simon and laura  with peter finch and the brilliant kay kendall . to this day  it stands as one of the finest examples of british comedy and  more particularly  about how television sitcoms become so popular . it was  and is  an excellent example also of self  referential cinema .  br    br   so also soapdish  a film i  d never heard about until a few nights ago when i caught it on late tv . i was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well  as you know .  br    br   however  i was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime american tv . in fact  it  s been a while since i laughed so heartily . so  if you like satire  i  d recommend you see it .  br    br   the main actors  sally field  kevin kline  robert downey and cathy moriarty  quite simply do an excellent job  revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is . as i watched it  i kept thinking to myself just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life  that is  if actors ever do have a real life  as you probably know  peter sellers  for example  was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters  so that nobody really knew the real person . so  as i watched sally field playing celeste talbot playing maggie  i thought again about that earlier british film with kay kendall playing laura playing a character in a tv sitcom opposite peter finch . . .  br    br   is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns  and that feeling was crystallized when celeste finally confronts her daughter  lori  played by elizabeth shue  and  in an emotional moment  repeats the fictional lines she  d used  on a prior episode of her daytime soap  when confronting her fictional daughter in that show  are you confused  well  it  s not all like that  but the dialog is stunning for originality  comedy  bitchiness  anger  depravity  duplicity  and even . . . love .  br    br   the story  well  there are many stories in this film  all interwoven  and which all come together at the end  of course  but not like a robert altman film  okay    and not all of them are resolved finally . life  s not like that anyway  right  the pace is almost frenetic  and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes . spend the   minutes from your life and watch it you won  t regret the time usage .  br    br   the rest of the cast all perform well  although i  ve never taken much to whoopi goldberg . perhaps the funniest exchanges are between robert downey and cathy moriarty and  for my money  the latter steals so many scenes from others  she gets my vote as the outstanding player . i kid you not  she gives the term bitch an entirely new face . . .  \n",
      "this film is stunningly beautiful . goldsworthy  s art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful  moving and changing and blossoming . i strongly recommend this movie to everyone . i can think of nothing else to say about it . it  s just the kind of movie you have to see  because it  s so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when i left the theatre .  \n",
      "a very engaging documentary about scottish artist andy goldsworthy  whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature . his work is made of rocks  leaves  grass  ice  etc .  that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field . thus  most of goldsworthy  s works don  t really last  except as photos or films of what they were . now  one can argue that goldsworthy  s works are a reflection of mortality  or words to that effect  but isn  t it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art . and at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter  pretentious  often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings  goldsworthy seems to be the opposite a stable  unpretentious  family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in scotland  of course  i  m sure those are the same reasons why he  s shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial  .  \n",
      "the scottish artist andy goldsworthy fashions natural materials into ephemeral artworks  assembling rocks into egg  shaped cairns  filling riverside rock  pools with fiery flowers and stitching thorns and twigs into intricate web patterns . an original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of southampton art gallery  near where i live   but although i found these pieces intriguing  i only realised the wonder of goldsworthy  s work when i was lucky enough to catch a re  screening of rivers and tides .  br    br   thomas reidelsheimer  s film  accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by fred frith  brings goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work . the opening scene captures him fusing icicle fragments into a snake  like thread set atop a tree  stump . working with his teeth and bare hands  goldsworthy crafts a beautiful  ephemeral work . before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant nova scotian sunlight . this scene is among the most beautiful in the film  but the breadth and inventiveness of goldsworthy  s work is remarkable . reidelsheimer shows both the successes and the failures  capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine  even if for just a few hours  minutes or seconds .  br    br   goldsworthy himself provides the narration  speaking slowly but thoughtfully about the themes in his work . he makes plain his need to work with nature  to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural materials  even when they seem to be working against him . at times he is down  to  earth and humorous at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose  something which is quite understandable when witnessing his astonishing work first hand . the  rivers and tides  of the title become increasingly pertinent as we see the natural materials pass through the artist  s hands  flowing from one form to the next . the capture of the creation and dissolution of goldworthy  s work is in itself a striking piece of art .  br    br   although goldsworthy works with widely varying materials and covers territory across north america and europe  the presentation of artworks one after the other in this film is exhausting it gave me the same feeling of fatigue that i get when i spend too long in an art gallery and struggle to take in anything new . a brief interval in which we are introduced to andy  s family and hometown is all that breaks the long succession of his artworks . nevertheless  reidelsheimer does a superb job in photographing goldsworthy and his creations  locating them in their wider environments  from meandering canadian rivers to rainy scottish hillsides . fittingly  the film ends with goldsworthy casting handfuls of earth and snow into the sky . fleeting patterns emerge from the dust particles even as they dissipate into the air this is the purest expression of the beauty to be found in the work of this remarkable artist .  \n",
      "the filmmaker inhaled andy goldsworthy  s art  his search for closeness with the land and the water  and his sense of proportion   and so gently  so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us .  rivers and tides  loves goldsworthy  s work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world  a world that hides its power in plain sight . see this movie   \n",
      "being a fan of andy goldsworthy  s art for a while now  and owning some of his books  i had some expectations of what i would see . what i got was something completely satisfying  and quite a bit more than i expected . being an artist myself  i work in clay   finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative  and it is something andy goldsworthy has mastered . following him over the course of a year  the director captures the spontaneous energy  skill  and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair . the music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating . if you are an artist in need of inspiration  or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience  then see this movie . i for one am glad to know that andy is somewhere out there . creating  dancing  wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful .  \n",
      "this german documentary  in english  is about a scottish environmental sculptor named andy goldsworthy . he makes art from objects he finds in nature . for example  early in the film we see him taking sections of icicles and  gluing  them together with a little moisture into a serpentine shape that seems to repeatedly go through a vertical rock .  br    br   of course  the icicles melt  but that transience is a part of most of goldsworthy  s work . he goes to a site and gets a feeling for it  deciding intuitively what to make that day . he talks of having a  dialog  with the rocks and other materials that he works with  attempting to work with rather than against them . it might be stones  or flowers  or leaves  or sticks . the sculpture might last for minutes or years  or might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed . the work seems to be more of a process than a goal .  br    br   the film  and the work  is beautiful  inspiring  and thought provoking . it moves pretty slowly  which is appropriate for the material  but you should be sure to go when you have had a good night  s sleep . but do go if you have the opportunity .  br    br   search the web for some other pages about andy goldsworthy or to read about his local sculpture at stanford university . there are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures .  br    br   my thoughts skip reading this part if you want to find what this film means to you completely independently . i recall a couple of ideas that occurred to me while watching the film which i thought i would share for those of you still reading . first  the transitory nature of much of andy goldsworthy  s work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life . we  re born  we live  and eventually we die . that  s natural  and that  s also naturally a part of goldsworthy  s art .  br    br   the other thought was to be awestruck with the way that goldsworthy has managed to integrate his passion and his work so thoroughly into his life . most of us have work which is tolerated at best  a life which we hardly notice living  and passions which we really mean to spend more time on  if we even remember what they are . andy goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well  and is nourishing for him and those around him . wow .  br    br   seen on          .  \n",
      "andy goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order  expressing the way through his sublime ephemeral art . indeed  time and change is what his work is fundamentally about . i bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times . so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film  he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect  and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world  the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all . he is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone  if they do anymore   creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it . mr . goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature  and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways . and always with the utmost respect  gratitude and humor of a wandering  and wondering monk .  \n",
      "as the jacket proclaims  this film is  gorgeously shot and masterfully edited   and  yes  it is mesmerizingly beautiful . the timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from goldsworthy  s hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity .  br    br   and so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in   or in the words of matthew arnold from  dover beach    br    br   listen  you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back  and fling  at their return  up the high strand  begin  and cease  and then again begin  with tremulous cadence slow  and bring the eternal note of sadness in .  br    br   at one point near the end of the film goldsworthy says that  words do their job  but what i  m doing here says a lot more .  as a wordsmith myself i take no offense and not for a moment do i think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates  is indeed something more than mere words can say .  br    br   at another point he remarks on  what is here to stay . . . and what isn  t .  that is his theme .  br    br   i think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral . the idea was  that by emphasizing how short  lived are even the mightiest works of humans  a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed .  br    br   perhaps part of the effectiveness of goldsworthy  s work is in this sort of expression . he painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it  or places it in the river where it will be swept away and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality .  br    br   both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it . and it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural . thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity  but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along .  br    br   this is art as art should be  akin to the spiritual .  br    br   in a sense goldsworthy  s work is an inarticulated understanding . it is an experience purely of time and form . in a sense his work  answers  shelley  s famous poem  ozymandias  by saying  even as the tide washes the work away  and even as the river dissipates the expression  even so the art lives on because of our experience of it . similarly one thinks of tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out  and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished  they are given to the wind  so that we might know that all is flux .  br    br   yet  in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos . goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer  of necessity i would say  and all his works  even the unsuccessful ones  he tells us  are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not .  br    br   this cinematic production directed by thomas riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by fred frith is not to be missed . it is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen and one of the most spiritual .  \n",
      "greetings again from the darkness . insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist . how strange for most of us to see someone who must work . . . no matter the conditions  else his reason for living ceases . to see goldsworthy  s sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic . this artist creates because he must  not for money or fame . it is his lifeforce . when you see his failures  energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon . it is not the dread of beginning again  it is that he takes his energy from his work . watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful  but nonetheless  breathtaking . he discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same . when he says he needs the earth  but it does not need him . . . i beg to differ . only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best .  \n",
      "on one level  this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again . on a deeper level though  it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land . i thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said   when i  m not out here  alone  for any length of time  i feel unrooted .   br    br   i considered andy goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists . i  m familiar with his works mainly through his coffee  table books and a couple art gallery installations . but to see his work in motion  captured perfectly through riedelsheimer  s lens  was a revelation . unfrozen in time  goldsworthy  s creations come alive  swirling  flying  dissolving  crumbling  crashing .  br    br   and that  s precisely what he  s all about time . the process of creation and destruction . of emergence and disappearing . of coming out of the void and becoming the universe  and back again . there  s a shamanic quality about him  verging on madness . you get the feeling  watching him at work  that his art is a lifeforce for him  that if he didn  t do it  he would whither and perish .  br    br   luckily for us  goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography . otherwise  with the exception of a few cairns and walls  they would only exist for one person .  \n",
      "this is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change . as usual the lovers   sally field as almost  over  the  hill soap opera queen  celeste talbert and kevin kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor  jeffrey anderson   are working at cross purposes  seemingly unaware that they are madly in love  etc . owing a little to bette davis  s margo channing in all about eve       and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition  sally field goes over the top towards hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and happiness . kevin kline  one of the more underrated leading men of recent years  is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome  vulnerable  egotistical and lovable all at the same time .  br    br   the misadventures center around celeste  s fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties  and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece  aspiring actress cori craven  elisabeth shue  who turns out not to be her niece  with ensuing plot complications . cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to celeste  and to jeffrey anderson as well    but never mind .  br    br   as a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are robert downey jr .  soap opera director  david barnes  and cathy moriarty  montana and nurse nan  . david barnes is oh so hot for her  but she cares only about one thing getting rid of celeste so that she might shine more brightly on the set . to this end she gets barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck celeste  s career  but through happenstance and  or a perverse logic  all his attempts go awry  much to the delight of the viewer .  br    br   whoopie goldberg plays rose schwartz  the show  s chief writer and celeste  s alter  ego and confidant while carrie fisher has a modest part as the hard  as  nails producer of the show .  br    br   i thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that i have seen  young doctors in love     which burlesqued tv  s general hospital and was pretty good  . soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh  out  loud one  liners and terrific performances by field  kline and downy  jr . but see this for sally field who is outstanding .  \n",
      "i admit that for the first   minutes or so of this film i wasn  t entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing . like many other people  i found it pretty boring  and i wasn  t entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together . however  if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product  you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is . i really think it  s sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists .  br    br   rivers and tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy  who makes his art entirely out of things in nature  generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy . it is slow moving and unglamorous  but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that goldsworthy  s art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated . i  ve even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie  rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves  which i just think is madness .  br    br   on the other hand  lots of people complain about cds coming with the lyrics written out inside them . a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics  i guess i  m just the kind of person that believes that i  d like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork . i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do . i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie . he does  after all  lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion  but if you don  t want goldsworthy talk about his art while you  re watching the film  feel free to turn the sound off . that  s like not reading the lyrics if you don  t want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourself .  br    br   i think that andy goldsworthy  s work  which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie  is incredibly impressive  and i  m glad that this film was made in order to showcase it . indeed  since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio  photography is the only medium other than film that can express it  and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art  and the way that only things from nature are used . whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented  goldsworthy  s work is moving enough to overlook that  because the film is not the star  goldsworthy  s art is . and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slow  moving nature of the film  it seems to me that director thomas riedelsheimer knows that .  \n",

      "this is the best movie i  ve come across in a long while . not only is this the best movie of its kind  school shooting  the way ben coccio  the director  decided to film it was magnificent . he filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school . he filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film . also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary . it is almost artful .  if that is indeed a word  there are a few slip ups however  for example when cal calls brads    land rover a range rover  or vice versa  it  s been awhile since i  ve seen it   \n",
      "i am frankly surprised how little has been done in film on the columbine massacre . there isn  t a major documentary  very puzzling . fortunately we are graced with the talent of ben coccio who directed zero day  and gus van sant who did the equally fine elephant . two different takes on the event  which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery  that there  s something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers  and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality . zero day  purportedly made up of videotapes made by the shooters and found after the event  is absolutely riveting . even if you know where it  s going  you still harbor hope that it won  t  go there  . . . and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating . the film is terrific from top to bottom  from director to script  not much improvised  though it appears very spontaneous  to the two lead actors  and the supporting players as well . there is only one aspect of zero day that troubled me . okay  so we can  t fathom why the shooters would do what they did  but certainly one of the contributors was their anger . yet these boys don  t really seem angry . they may say some things to indicate that they are  but in fact they didn  t convince me that they had something inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people . but this still leaves me with the sense of  why     that director coccio wants me to have . anyway  rent or buy this movie  it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time . the blair witch folks could only wish for the kind of success these guys had at making a mock documentary .  \n",
      "everyone knows about this   zero day   event . what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were . they showed their life for about a year . throughout the movie we get to like them  to laugh with them even though we totally know what they  re gonna do . and that gives me the chills . cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments  and i just thought cal was a sweet guy . even though i knew what was gonna happen you know  even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of  or  i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off . of course i was . i got to like them . they were wicked  maybe  but i felt like they were really normal guys  that they didn  t really realize it . but i knew they were .  br    br   that  s  imo  the main force of this movie . it makes us realize that our friends  or relatives  or anyone  can be planning something crazy  and that we won  t even notice it . this movie  as good as it was  made me feel bad . and that  s why i can  t go to sleep right now . there  s still this little feeling in my stomach . butterflies .  \n",

      "i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was . i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed . the two lead actors are awesome  the film isn  t ever boring  and the concept behind it  though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers  is really interesting . there are some weaknesses  such as the final   minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn  t make any sense at all . the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction  but in cinema verite that is a given . but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit .  \n",
      "as a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings  this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea . presented as a series of video recordings made by the two troubled men  i cannot refer to persons who kill as boys or teens   the months of preparation leading to zero day  the codename for the day on which they will attack  the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun . it seems intent on portraying the pain they suffer  yet focuses on the literal preparation . the problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered . the only point at which emotion became overwhelming was the ending  as expected . but leading up to this point  it  s never really clear as to why they are planning this out . we are told the obligatory story that they were mocked  but the film also seems to contradict this . without ruining the film  it  s easy to say it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions  but falls short because of sloppy film  making . all directing is amateur  to further the homemade video concept  but the story and continuity is weak . the film seems to want the audience to decide a lot  but also fails to provide the information for such an event . the ending is abrupt  and doesn  t feel like it finishes everything that the film began .  \n",
      "zero day is a film few people have gotten to see  and what a shame that is .  br    br   when i saw the end  where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people  then commit suicide  and it made me grab my stomach . i was shaking  that  s how strong this movie is .  br    br   the movie is amazing . it  s too incredible not to get a perfect ten . it  s sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film . it is not a budget which makes a film good  it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it good .  br    br   it leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply cannot get out . it makes you realise the true horror of shootings  especially if you were to know that person  and this movie makes you feel like you know these people .  br    br   i recommend zero hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it . i am fourteen  and i feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words . it feels like you  re watching something that actually happened .  \n",
      "this movie is one for the ages . first  i have to say after seeing this once  it became one of my all  time favorite movies . why  simple ben coccio  writer  director  has put together a true piece of art . where   .   of movies these days are purely entertainment  director ben coccio gives us truth  gives us reality  gives us a learning tool to know why this happened . the mainstream media spins and spins but ben coccio looks school shootings right in the face  able to go where no other form of media has ever gone before  into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates . while it surely is graphic and horrifying  how couldn  t it be  the gloves come off  the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened . sometimes it isn  t just a screw loose like everyone likes to think  no  sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper  are more human  we are shown that these boys are us and we them . society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real .  br    br   respect and love your fellow man . a lesson we all should learn  thank you so much for making this film mr . coccio  i hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film  making career .  \n",
      "zero day has a purpose and this is not simply entertainment  it delivers a message about its specialised subject school shootings . charting the lives of two friends andre and cal leading up to an attack on their high school .  br    br   whilst the movie started in somewhat unassuming fashion  an impromptu announcement of the coming attack in amateurish teenage style followed by some brief encounters with the boys families . it is not long before we are down to business with the boys showing us their collection of guns  their fetishistic love of them  their sprawling sporadic narcissistic fantasies and even in a controversial scene how to build pipe bombs .  br    br   so what is the movie trying to say  what is really motivating these soon to be killers . it seems hard to really pinpoint . they certainly do not come across as cold blooded psychopaths yet they are planning an act of sheer brutality . this brings me to what i feel is the genius in part of zero day . cal and andre talk constantly about how much they are on a different level  how above the rest of us they are and how they will  leave us all behind .  like the columbine killers they truly feel superior . like nietzsche  s res sentiment cal and andre  s value system seems to have been born out of rejection from their society . yet we are given only glimpses of this  an expression of hatred for a popular athlete for example . so where is the motivation  what i feel is that coccio portrayed two individuals desperate to make a statement of superiority a gesture of their power yet who have no reasonable venue for it . hence they turn to mass murder and the kind of which that will garner them more attention than they could ever realise . this is why in part school shooters seem able to carry out atrocious acts despite coming from good stable loving homes . the murder is part of a fantasy  cal and andre are totally lost in their fantasy they almost fail to see the reality of their actions . they turn fantasy into tragedy .  br    br   what is secondly most enthralling about this film is the character development and the unique dependence cal and andre have on each other . andre is throughout the film overtly the leader of the two  cal  s embrace of his demeanour and attire seem somewhat forced . andre is uptight  andre is intense and serious . he completely shuns others except for his family  he is meticulous and precise about everything he does and for a while appears the prime mover in the plot to attack the school . yet he is likable in his own way  he does not embrace teenage nonsense and in part we feel compelled to agree with him  yet these moments are shattered by andre  s fleeting gestures of violence towards us the audience treating us as both confidante and potential victim . cal on the other hand seems more relaxed than andre  more accepting of reality . yet he is in his own way dominant . we have many personal moments of introspection with cal  s video diary  scenes when he is alone and apart from andre . cal seems to be struggling with his own personal demons and using their plan to exorcise himself of them . andre is jealous of cal going to the prom with an old friend  he wants cal all to himself . cal placates andre and encourages him . for the first time in his life andre seems to have found someone who believes in him and who admires him he cannot lose it . whilst cal has found someone offering him a way out .  br    br   the movie certainly picks up pace and improves as it nears its grim conclusion . there is an excellent moment when cal attends the high school prom . suddenly the star of the movie becomes shy and introverted  not at all at ease with his peers . yet we are inclined to feel more connection with cal than with the raucous bawdy crowd screaming juvenile obscenities whilst drinking heavily in their limo . theirs is an episode all too common and recognisable . we do not want to relate to them  when it is over and cal is back with andre silently preparing one of their final videos we like the characters feel once again at ease safe in the fantasy world they created . we feel like shunning the masses as they have .  br    br   the penultimate scene is superb . the final video sees andre and cal arming themselves in their car just moments before attacking . it is all too real and truly creates a sense of impending doom . by know we know cal and andre and are realising they are about to actually do it  with a kind of morbid fascination we are also relishing the films catharsis .  br    br   the massacre shot in cctv fashion is at times shocking  and whilst it was certainly the perfect choice to depict the massacre if we were going to it is not void of flaws . what is most significant is the sudden radical change of perception we have of cal and andre  looking at them in the this person suddenly they are the callous killers we knew they would become yet refused to acknowledge that they would . it is violent and real  our heroes have become monsters and the reality of their fantasy is a terrible tragedy  which costs them everything .  br    br   the final scene shows a group of teens filming themselves burning the crosses erected for andre and cal in disgust that they have been memorialised . having known andre and cal we can only feel almost a sadness that they are actually gone forever and that they certainly did not win anything .  br    br   zero day is a must see for anyone interested in these violent acts sensationalised by the media . it is a character study well worth experiencing .  \n",
      "zero day is based of columbine high school massacre . and its a video diary of two boys . at first you don  t know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film . until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school . until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods . they is a lot to say about this movie . all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys made .  br    br   the two boys act like they are in a weird cult . they burn all there stuff . like play station games books dvds homework stuff school stuff . these two boys can be anybody your friends you brothers or the people you see walking down the street . it goes through there daily actives  and that is making a gun . in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into i  m not saying its right but many people do do things like that .  br    br   and also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this film .  br    br   so thats my review on zero day .  br    br   and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up .  \n",
      "in my honest opinion  everyone should see this movie at least once . it really put things in perspective as i watched it . though it was fictional  this movie is about something that could happen to your children .  br    br   it shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school  and their plans to murder innocent students . this film would not have worked in any other format . they pulled off the hand  held camera  perfectly .  br    br   it reminds us of april   th       when eric harris  and dylan klebold murdered   students and then themselves . it also reminds us of the media storm that followed after . everyone wanted to see the rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes .  br    br   this movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true . we get to see the kid behind the monster .  br    br   the only bad thing about this movie  is that it did not do well on the market  and few people even know it existed . if it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie  everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about  zero day .  br    br   i believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it . the shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film  because it mostly focuses on cal and andre  and what they did up to that point .  br    br   if you have not yet seen this movie  go rent it  and watch it . i guarantee that when it is finished  you will be speechless .  \n",
      "chris and andre are two average  ordinary teens . misunderstood by some and picked on by others . but together they stand and all will pay . together they form  the army of two  . they scheme and plan  zero day  . that day is when they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder   people in cold blood . told through the tapes that they made  zero day   it is barely a fictionalized telling of the columbine tragedy .  br    br    zero day  is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards . the two main actors  calvin robertson and andre keuck  do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teen walking the street . their performances were very believable  you kinda liked these guys and that was scary . shot on video almost totally from the teen  s perspectives  zero day  feels very real and authentic  like you are right there . these kids try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and the actors sell it to you . but be warned it does follow the tragedy from beginning to end and the ending makes be shocking and uneasy for some .  \n",
      "this movie was excellent  a bit scary  but excellent at that . for those of you that have heard of columbine and know the story  it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did . in the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff  but you never realize just how bad it is  and this movie makes you realize . it  s seriously that good . it also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone that  s for sure . i read a book on the columbine massacre and it made me think  this movie makes me worry and scares me to death . on the downside it  s like a how to kill someone guide for serial killers . i recently received a threat  and i blew it off thinking nothing of it  but after this movie i think you should take everything seriously . some people are crazy and you never truly know which they are  so take it seriously and don  t under estimate someone .  \n",

      "this movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it . in some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video diary from killers it is full on account of a  columbine  style attack . while this movie does not answer all the big questions  it does give you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with . through the movie you are shown how the actors illegally shortened shot guns  made pipe bombs and came up with an action plan for  zero day  . the actors  if you can call them that  were brilliant  they obviously borrowed heavily from there own lives  but at no stage did i detect them really acting  something tom cruise should try  . the use of the cctv and the    operator at the end was genius  but i  m not sure if we needed the very last scene . overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic .  \n",
      "the thing that makes this movie so scary is the way that it portrays andre and calvin as  relatively  normal guys . these are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera  forget scripted lines  etc . they are only making the video as a diary to show  the survivors  how normal their lives were . their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video . by researching other kids attacks on their schools  andre and calvin learn what not to do and they inform  usually in a silly  this old house  kind of way  any potential  andres and calvins  who might be watching this video how to make bombs  get weapons  and not get caught before zero day  the day of the attack  .  \n",

      "as always  controversial movies like this have mixed reviews . you either love it or you hate it  and not everyone will like this movie . this shows the perspective of the killers  which is something i personally feel is something important to consider . you may hate them  you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate  but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective .  br    br   the movie is shot entirely using a hand  held camera  something that i think works quite well as it makes it more realistic . it is told completely from the killers point of view  from their  missions  to family outings  all leading up the big day  zero day  in which they are planning on a massacre at their school . zero day does not offer answers  but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves . our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred  but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing . they are shown to be surprisingly normal  typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives  and if we didn  t know what they were planning we wouldn  t expect a thing  they make it clear throughout the whole movie that no  one else knows about their plan   br    br   the acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete unknowns . we can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future . despite how this is a fictionalized movie  one cannot help but notice the obvious similarities to columbine . calvin and andre are scarily similar to eric harris and dylan klebold   not so much in looks  but in manner  as someone who has researched columbine very extensively  i could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it .  br    br   the actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things i have ever seen . i was completely in shock after seeing it  and its a feeling that stays around for a while . it is very realistic and well  done  and it is very difficult to watch .  br    br   all in all zero day is an excellent movie  and i think everyone should at least check it out . in the past  we have always simply branded killers  psychopaths  and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence  but as zero day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that  and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers .  \n",
      "i rented zero day from the local video store last week . i had never heard of the film and i had my reservations about it . just from looking at the box i knew the film was an indie film and therefore the quality was going to be less than a mainstream film .  br    br   i can tell you that after i finished watching zero day i immediately started it from the beginning again . the film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at columbine high school of april of      but what struck me was how believable the two lead actors were . my first time through watching this film i wasn  t entirely sure if what i was watching were actual tapes left behind by the shooters at columbine . in the back of my mind i knew what i was watching could not be real but at the same time the acting was so convincing you had to keep giving your head a shake .  br    br   is the film disturbing  absolutely  are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the film  probably . i think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two lead characters  calvin and andre  played by cal robertson and andre keuck  . why is that problematic for some people  calvin and andre are planning a massacre at their high school . i know for myself  i felt an immense sadness for andre and calvin . i had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a horrific point . they had fallen so deeply through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road which could have been stopped  if only people around them had taken notice to their plight .  br    br   zero day is a phenomenal film . it gives you an up close and personal look to events that most of us will only ever see the conclusion to on the news . it leaves you thinking about the lives involved . and it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point . a week after seeing this film  i still think about it .  br    br   those of you who have not seen zero day please keep in mind the following the film is an independent with little to no budget and the film is shot on camcorders . the material in the film is disturbing . this is not mainstream hollywood and there is no happy ending .  br    br   but if you can put all that aside  zero day is a film that will stick with you and just maybe help you to open your eyes a little .  \n",

      "the unborn is a very  very different film . james karen  brooke adams are in the film and they performed quite well . this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going . though i think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot . there is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like me that  s into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that  s it when it comes to that . there is a scene where adams  character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real . the music is very different but very good . the unborn in my opinion is a really creepy film that  s superbly unpredictable and that  s quite strange  i recommend all horror fans to this movie   \n",

      "  kolchak the night stalker  is a hugely entertaining tv series in which a pushy  sarcastic  forty  something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural  and occasionally extraterrestrial  forces . based on a very popular pair of tv movies featuring the kolchak character  this series died a quick death in the mid      s due to low ratings  but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today . but will the average modern  day viewer be able to dig kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead   br    br   that  s actually a tough question to answer fairly . detractors of this series tend to argue that it  s formulaic and hopelessly dated . on the other hand  fans argue that it  s cleverly written  well  acted  and sometimes genuinely spooky . and me  i  ve got a foot in both camps . i thoroughly enjoyed watching all   episodes of kolchak on dvd recently  though i can plainly see that the series has major flaws .  br    br   i  ll address the question of kolchak being  formula  fiction first . now  i think we can all agree that most tv shows have formulas  just about every episode of columbo unfolds according to the same pattern  for example . repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself in fact  critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy  and actively seek out  repetitive entertainment . however  the problem with kolchak is that its formula is simply too rigid  it  s too repetitive even by the most generous standards .  br    br   in almost every episode  kolchak investigates a murder  and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster . he tries to publish a story about said monster  but his editor vincenzo blocks him  always on the grounds that kolchak doesn  t have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work . and  alas  kolchak is also obstructed by the police . so  in the end  kolchak does some independent research on the monster  figures out how to kill it . . . and then kills it . without ceremony  or reward  or writing a big story about it .  br    br   you can see where this ever  so  strict formula might get tiresome  right  i  m particularly mystified by vincenzo  if kolchak  s always raving about monsters  and vincenzo never believes it . . . well  then  why doesn  t vincenzo fire kolchak  or have him committed  that  s what any normal boss would do . but the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep vincenzo and kolchak as comical antagonists . as a result  many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable  though they are also quite funny .  br    br   the very best episodes of kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula  however  usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist . these select episodes are good enough that i think they  re largely immune to typical criticisms of the series . some of my favorites include  br    br   horror in the heights  an episode that  s noteworthy for being grimy  inventive and socially aware . kolchak  s dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge . though it adheres closely to the kolchak formula  the script  written by hammer studios veteran jimmy sangster  is remarkably literate  and it delves deeply into the monster  s backstory .  br    br   the devil  s platform  a possible inspiration for the  omen  films  this episode stands out to me because the villain  a very young tom skerritt  tempts kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies  and  in so doing  reveals a lot about the reporter  s character .   br    br   firefall  this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans  but i enjoyed it because it  s got a great red herring and a really creepy  almost unstoppable  seeming monster .  br    br   though i  ve singled out these three episodes for praise  i  d say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least . for my money  there are only two complete turkeys in the    episode run primal scream  which is about monkey  men running rampant in chicago  and the sentry  which features the dumbest  looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment  and this assessment is coming from a lifelong doctor who and godzilla fan    br    br   on balance  then  this is a good series . a little repetitive  a little cheesy perhaps  but it has elements of greatness . even during the weaker episodes  darren mcgavin  s wonderful performance as the caustic  world  weary  endlessly funny kolchak truly shines . he carries the series effortlessly  in a way that  for example  sarah michelle gellar never managed on  buffy .  mcgavin was one great character actor  and this series is worth watching for him alone .  \n",

      "a couple of years back i had purchased  and enjoyed  the mgm double  feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies  the night stalker       and the night strangler       . when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out  i had intended to buy it immediately  but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd    s kept me from adding it to my collection recently  i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak   discer as well .  br    br   having watched it now  i can safely say that i didn  t regret acquiring this beloved  if short  lived  crime  horror series one bit it may follow a standardized formula  dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak  marvelously played by darren mcgavin  gets into everybody  s hair with his attitude  flustered editor simon oakland  long  suffering colleagues  assorted authoritarian figures  a plethora of monsters and villains   faces up to the inevitable  and usually supernatural  threat alone but  finally  is pressured into keeping his story under wraps  but a winning one  further boosted by an impressive line  up of guest stars and notable behind  the  scenes credits   making the show a great deal of fun .  br    br   that said  quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make  up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired  for instance  the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment   not to mention the fact that these were restricted to    minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes  in the case of the werewolf  again  he  s never seen biting anyone but  somewhat foolishly  is made to merely throw people around    br    br   while the hero  s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots  there  s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode  often  but not exclusively  revolving around mcgavin  s relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage   to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere  the setting  for the most part  is chicago  and suspense . to make the ride even more pleasant  there  s a bouncy score by gil melle  and jerry fielding .  br    br   for the record  the monsters encountered  but not always defeated  by kolchak throughout the series are a revived jack the ripper  a variety of cults  voodoo  native american  aztec   aliens  vampire  werewolf  going round its over  familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise  liner    doppelganger  satanist  swamp creature  mass of electricity  robot  apeman  witch  headless motorcyclist  succubus  a knight  s armor taking a murderous life of its own  the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast  featuring john dehner as a morose police captain  hans conried and robert emhardt   helen of troy    and crocodile . some of the actors  other than those playing kolchak  s co  workers  return in the same roles  keenan wynn and ramon bieri  both as officers of the law   john fiedler  as a shrewd morgue attendant  and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero . if i were pressed to choose the finest  or most entertaining  episodes  i  d lean towards horror in the heights  co  starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer  and the afore  mentioned the knightly murders  while  as the weakest  i  d go for the werewolf  due to reasons i  ve already explained  and chopper  based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale   .  br    br   unfortunately  the set contains no extras it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak the night stalker  as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing  or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci  fi series popular today . in fact  kolchak himself  in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise  returned in a     revival this version is available at my local dvd rental outletbut  for various reasons  i  m not sure i  d want to check it out so soon after the       classic   \n",

      "i remember the original series vividly mostly due to it  s unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter . kolchak was hard  bitten newsman from the ben hecht school of big  city reporting  and his gritty determination and wise  ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable . my personal fave was  the spanish moss murders  due to it  s totally original storyline . a poor  troubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou country  takes part in a sleep research experiment  for the purpose of dream analysis . something goes inexplicably wrong  and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth . this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state  and brutally suffocates them to death . kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth  much to the chagrin of police captain joe  mad dog  siska  wonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynn  and the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder  severn darden  to droll  understated perfection . the wickedly funny  harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system  and is a series highlight . kolchak never got any better . timeless .  \n",

credits set the playful scene with kitsch late     s cartoon stills an enchanting peres  prez  prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited  but his grunts are unmistakable  and no  one else did them   and with familiar cast names  including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts    plus teri hatcher from tv  s superman .  br    br   every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors  actresses and producers in daytime tv . peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old  fashioned  delicious farce . robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine  but feels like a gift to us in the audience . some of the cliched characters are a bit dim  but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy  especially against celeste talbert  sally field  who is the show  s perennial award  winning lead  nicknamed  america  s sweetheart  . the daytime emmies  like awards opening does introduce us to celeste  s show  the sun also sets . against all vain fears to the contrary  celeste wins again . she is overjoyed  because it  s always  such a genuine thrill    adam  did you watch  i won  well  nguh . . .  the reason for adam  s absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot  and we  re instantly off on a trip with celeste  s neuroses . she cries  screeches  and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee  kathy najimi  constantly waddling after celeste  unseen through celeste  s fog of paranoia  indulges a taste for tammy faye baker  for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hired .  br    br   rosie schwartz  whoopi goldberg  has seen it all before . she is the head writer of the show  and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for   years . so when celeste freaks  rosie offers to write her off the show for six months  we  ll just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama .

geoffrey .  you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf   and indeed  seeing geoffrey  s dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious . back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room  geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as  mr loman  . he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe  and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer . now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven  the show  s new ingenue so he  s not leaving .  br    br   beautiful elizabeth shue  as laurie  rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well . but  of course  the course to true love never

celeste settle her nerves  or will she kill tawnee first  will the producer get mr fuzzy   you  ll just have to watch  the second half  of this utterly lovable  farcically malicious riot .  br    br

      "i loved kolchak the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september        . i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle  hey  where  s the soundtrack guys   and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple  important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level . when darren mcgavin  s carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations  he reacts like most people would . he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger  he is frightened  even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode . it  s rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force . he  s usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works . sometimes  he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are . in one episode  he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it  he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly  he must go back and defend himself . he  s heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn  t do but that doesn  t mean he probably wouldn  t much rather someone else did it instead of him . he  s a regular guy  doing a job  trying to make a buck  not a monster  hunter . he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural  which he has an interest in but he doesn  t want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do . if his plan to defeat the creature didn  t work  you will often see him running for his life to get away from it  which is of course what i would do in the situation . that  s why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid . kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him . you were scared for him and for the other characters too . the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit  scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it  s all for naught if you don  t care about the characters . darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a  monster of the week  show and he decided not to continue . i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but  as an adult  i can see why it couldn  t go on in that formula for very long . i still love the   episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling  determined and brusk but good  hearted reporter for the ins  known as carl kolchak . i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show . it  s not the monsters  darkly  lit sets  creepy music or goofy guest stars  although they are all vital ingredients . the secret to it  s success is right there in the title   kolchak the night stalker  . without mcgavin  s lovable  bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for  then it just ain  t a night stalker .  \n",
      "weak scripts at times  yep  cheesy special effects at times  yep  deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time  yep  more about carl kolchak and darren mcgavin  yep  i always enjoyed science fiction as a kid  but found so much of the dracula  frankenstein  mummy  horror stuff as just so much crap . it took abbott and costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters  and it took carl kolchak to win me over to the  dark side  of entertainment . the duke had rooster cogburn  eastwood had dirty harry  garner had maverick and rockford  selleck had magnum  and darren mcgavin had carl kolchak . mixed in with all those weak scripts  cheesy special effects  that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars  there was darren mcgavin as carl kolchak . he had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger  was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth  and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover  up by government officials . additionally  unlike    of us  kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done  even if it meant his demise  the end of his journalistic career  or jail time . for all his faults  including no taste in clothes  carl kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow mustang  which was an old used car at the time  on his way to save the day for humanity . as good as any other fictional hero carl kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to darren mcgavin . now that he  s passed on and his show is on dvd  i hope he  s having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing kolchak the night stalker all over again   \n",

      "bill crain  s rarer than rare  slasher  movie certainly doesn  t follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts . the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons  a sin that  s virtually unacceptable in most post  halloween genre pieces . but there  s still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you  ve grown to expect . just as wally koz  s surprisingly decent    was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family  mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director . looking through the credits i noticed numerous  crains  listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature . but despite fairly good distribution across the globe  the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market . nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down  br    br   it all takes place in the middle of the dessert  which as i  m sure you  ll agree is hardly the most exciting location . with that said though  i must admit that there  s certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly . four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way . chris  jennifer mcallister  and her boyfriend greg  kenny johnson  meet up with amusing new age hippies trip  kevin mcparland  and mary  nicole anton  at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune  like wilderness . greg  s older brother kyle  todd schaefer  and his buxom girlfriend bambi  laura albert  soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave . kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesn  t seem too keen to forget . sound like a motive for a massacre  well what did you expect  before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve . will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel   br    br   i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature . i don  t even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others . mirage certainly doesn  t appear on his official filmography  so your guess is as good as mine . judging by the credible work behind the camera  i  d have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience . the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain  and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it  s necessary . r . christopher biggs  gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome  and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent   rating . a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre . one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade  while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck  there  s also some black humor that  s surely unintentional . we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer  s boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters . but when he  s revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted  s bogus journey  i didn  t quite know what to expect . thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically .  br    br   there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast . the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b . g . steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse . the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn  t come at the cost of thespian potential . the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation  which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs . watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film  making at it  s freakiest .  br    br   mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite . when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck  you have to say that they did a damn good job . the flaws are numerous  but never detract credibility from the net result . unfortunately you  ve probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy . if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store  then make sure you pick it up . recommended .  \n",

      "some of the best movies that are categorized as  comedies  actually blur between comedy and drama .  the graduate  and  butch cassidy and the sundance kid   which were made also in the late      s are perfect examples . are they comedies with dramatic undertones  or dramas with a lot of humor  in many respects   the odd couple  falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep underpinnings about human nature . much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing .  br    br   despite the rather light  hearted tv show of the      s  the original  odd couple  is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation . it  s really about two opposites who must face why their marriages fell apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasies reveal themselves outside of their marriage . neatness  the characteristic of felix ungar  jack lemon perfectly cast  and messiness  the characteristic of oscar madison  walter matthau   are only the beginning and somewhat superficial . as the story unfolds  we find there is a lot more to these men than simply neatness versus messiness .  br    br   briefly  the story is really about felix ungar  who has to face an impending divorce from his wife francis  who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story . on the verge of suicide  ungar goes to the only place he knows the apartment of oscar madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often . we learn that ungar is not only a member of this  poker club  but the group knows what  s happening to him and try  in their inept way  to help out . madison figures the best way to help ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off .  br    br   unfortunately for madison  he doesn  t know what he  s getting himself into . madison is a carefree happy  go  lucky if rather irresponsible slob who  s refrigerator was last cleaned probably when herbert hoover was still in the white house . madison  s idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread  and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table . on the other hand  he enjoys booze and women  in short having a good time .  br    br   ungar is not only altogether different  he is diametrically opposite . he is not only an obsessive neatness nut that finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating . at one point  he calls his ex  wife  not to talk about reconciling  but to get her recipe for meatloaf . at another moment  ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw . when madison seems unimpressed  ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can  t stand coleslaw . who is this guy  but he has another endearing trait felix is also a hypochondriac . he obsesses about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he  s helping his sinuses . he seems to have every health condition in the book . and if they made up more  felix would probably have them . ultimately  he is overly self  absorbed .  br    br   running throughout the movie are references to marriage . at one point when madison is trying to convince ungar to move in  he says   what do you want  a wedding ring   but little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can  t deal with the messy guy  but the other way around . their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship . and the climax occurs when oscar invites two lonely british sisters for a get  together with both comedic and tragic results . this is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed  with superlative performances by walter matthau and jack lemon in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else . it is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today .  \n",
      "the original movie  the odd couple  has some wonderful comic one  liners . the entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat  freak felix ungar and funny  obnoxious  slob oscar madison . this paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful tv series of all time as well as countless  not anywhere near as good  imitations .  br    br   the odd couple movie has some wonderful jokes about oscar  s apartment and his sloppy habits . he says   who wants food   one of his poker player buddies asks   what do ya got   oscar says   i got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches .   what  s the brown   it  s either very new cheese or very old meat   i also love the line about oscar  s refrigerator   it  s been out of order for two weeks  i saw milk standing in there that wasn  t even in a bottle   there is no question that walter matthau  s oscar madison is a joy to watch on screen . he  s almost as good as jack klugman  s version in the tv series .  br    br   the problem with the movie is jack lemmon  s felix ungar . jack makes a very  very  honest effort at the role . the problem is that he makes felix so depressing and down  trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical . tony randall  s performance in the series  brought the kind of humor  warmth  and sensitivity  to felix  s character  which lemmon  s portrayal lacks . tony  s felix unger obviously could be annoying some of the time . however  in the tv series  it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline . jack  s felix ungar   note the different spelling  in the movie  seems to never be happy  fun  or interesting . the movie felix ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall  all the time .  br    br   the movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time  the  famous  meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever  one of the other great examples of felix  s  little notes  on oscar  s pillow will be remembered forever . however  there are some darker sides where oscar goes over the top  his  crying  near the end after bawling out felix  and a scene involving felix  s linguine dinner   although lightened by a funny line .  seem more depressing than comical .  br    br   perhaps there wasn  t enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie . the beginning   minutes are very boring . the same issue occurs with felix  s conversation with the pidgeon sisters . the movie  s ending is predictable and too pat . there  s very little care or compassion for each of them by the other . the result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger  rather than comedy  unless you are watching the great scenes described above . it appears that jack lemmon  s monotone persona of felix brings the film down  rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters .  br    br   it really took the      s tv series to make the odd couple the best that it could be . the original film is still very good . however  the tv series is much better .  \n",

      "there  s more to offer in the opening of the odd couple than in the entirety of most films . felix unger  the poor guy  s monogram even curses him  checks into a new york hotel . a cleaning lady says  good night .   goodbye   he answers back . in his room he empties his pockets  then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope  addressed to his wife and beloved children . when the viewer finally puts it together  aha  he  s going to off himself  we watch him struggle to open the window  oh no  he  s going to jump  the poor guy injures his lower back . this is all you need to know about felix unger  his wife has left him  he  s a compulsive cleaner and he  s a hypochondriac . and all in one scene . this is the particular genius of neil simon  s comedy  it  s about situation and character . there are few obvious physical jokes  no kicks to the groin  no cheap gags  just funny characters in uncomfortable situations . and  of course  he is a master of manipulating the audience  s expectations . coming from the swingers era  imagine what i thought in the date scene when felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment . he  s blowing it  right  think again . the girls love his sensitivity  his ability to cry in front of them . they invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because oscar wasn  t paying enough attention to it . he  s in like flynn  right  uh  yes  but he doesn  t want to go with the girls because he  s feeling vulnerable . great stuff . and it  s made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight  room apartment set . you  ve got jack lemmon and the slouchy  pouchy walter matthau for chrissakes  why mess it up  the visual style reminded me of breakfast at tiffany  s  in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action . particularly memorable is the scene in which felix  fleeing from oscar  closes a partition only to realize the partition doesn  t cover the side where oscar is coming from . you get a real sense of the layout of the apartment  and thus the proximity in which the two divorces live . the twist here is that these two are really married  to each other . so the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys .  \n",
      "i don  t think i  ve really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer . he  s certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles  but i guess i always put his success down to his characters  grumpiness and ruthlessness  a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co  star jack lemmon  and  i suppose  a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures . watching gene saks   the odd couple         adapted from a popular neil simon play  the realisation suddenly clicked matthau is  in his own right  absolutely hilarious  initially striking the audience as filthy  crude and generally unappealing  his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts  culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own . at the same time  while holding his own as a comedian  his interplay with lemmon is  of course  pitch  perfect indeed  the film rightly belongs to both actors  who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves  let alone together .  br    br   calling to mind billy wilder  s screenplay for  the apartment         this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise . compulsive house  cleaner felix unger  lemmon   having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years  attempts to commit suicide  but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window . dejected  he arrives at the house of good friend oscar  matthau   a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches  that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat   . oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay  but is soon overwhelmed by his friend  s finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness . the pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement  with felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly  nagging wife  and oscar as the sloppy  unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he  s supposed to . this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks  and  by the end of it  we can completely sympathise with felix  s ex  wife  who remains unseen .  br    br    the odd couple  is a terrific comedy  most of all because it has a lot of heart . for all their arguing  it  s obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other  most movingly seen when felix tries to launch into a furious tirade  instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up informing oscar how  tops  he his . the pair  s four poker buddies  john fiedler  herb edelman  david sheiner and larry haines  are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance  but you can  t deny that they  ve got the best of intentions . their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory  but maybe being ignored wasn  t quite the correct solution to felix  s gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality . unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays i was recently disappointed by wilder  s  the seven year itch         this film doesn  t simply strike at the same chord throughout  and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed  through tears  laughter and much disagreement .  \n",

      "this movie catches a lot of flak  but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered  clothed version of the film that played us television and has also been issued to death on vhs and dvd buy companies like alpha  unicorn  etc . this movie never had a theatrical release in the states  although it was picked up by avco embassy in     . in spain at the time  when there was nudity involved  the filmmakers shot two versions  one with clothes and one with out . the fully uncut english dubbed export print was titled werewolf never sleeps and seems to have been released to home video only in sweden back in the    s . it can be found on ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended . my guess is avco cut the film down for a r rated release that never happened . in     it was released by avco to television titled fury of the wolfman and the clothed version was used for this tv print . cut to   years later and fury of the wolfman pops up on home video on the charter label . this version appears to be what avco was going to release back in    . it  s the uncovered version  with some nudity that would never pass on tv or in a pg movie . there are several scenes on the charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the tv print  the source for all those dollar dud  s and vhs editions  . but a comparison to the fully uncut wolfman never sleeps reveals that  scenes are cut on this version   spoilers in next paragraph  the scene where ilona has waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete . after whipping him into submission  she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf    the werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too . this scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat . it  s not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for us audiences  or more likely the mpaa . ilona is desperately in love with waldemar and could not possess him  hence her whole scheme to mind control waldermar  s wife and involve her in an affair . she wanted to wreck his marriage  and she accomplishes this while waldemar is in tibet . unfortunately he returns a werewolf  but this does not slow her down a bit . if she can  t physically have him as a man  she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf . this also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window . this scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense . in the uncut version  it would seem ilona  s affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release  so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping . the other cut is a complete scene of waldemar in bed with karen and she is seen naked . a very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the us version of werewolf shadow  werewolf vs the vampire woman  as well . the film does have it  s problems though  for certain . the director was drunk  the bad stand in for the werewolf at points  the atrocious english dubbing  the inclusion of sequences from the first waldemar film mark of the wolfman aka frankenstein  s bloody terror and the grotesque overuse of that film  s music score throughout etc  but seen in it  s original widescreen format and uncut  ie werewolf never sleeps  it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the daninsky werewolf series  with a plot line unmatched in it  s everything but the kitchen sink approach . the cut  clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors  and unfortunately that  s the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen . the film carries a     copyright  and i  d bet the     release date on the imdb is incorrect . the film precedes werewolf shadow  aka werewolf vs the vampire woman  in the series and was certainly released before werewolf shadow . the ending of werewolf never sleeps  fury of the wolfman dovetails directly into the opening of werewolf shadow  offering concrete evidence of this . sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release . a perfect release would be the uncut english version but in spanish with english subtitles . the english dubbing severely hurts the movie . but any spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in spain during the franco era  where nudity was verboten .  \n",

      "someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing paul naschy  s  fury of the wolfman  to the great spanish surrealist films   l  age d  or  and  un chien andelou  . the naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end . dali and bunuel probably loved it  and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off .  br    br   the film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from a to b to c . some mishmash about a  professor walterman    his first name  mind you   who was bitten by a yeti monster during an expedition to tibet and hasn  t been the same since  which is understandable . one of his jealous colleagues  the insane daughter of the noted doctor wolfstein  knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him . but its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast .  br    br    walterman  flips out  turns into a werewolf  kills a few people  is electrocuted  dies  is buried  unburied  taken to a castle filled with circus freaks  wired to various machines  zapped with assorted electronic effects  injected with potent elixirs  is chained up  turns into a werewolf  a woman in an evening gown with thigh  high nazi fetish boots whips him  he escapes  helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle  fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe  eventually turns back into a werewolf  and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife . the lady with the nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her luger pistol  they die together  and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter  who did nothing .  look  what a beautiful day it is    br    br    la furia del hombre lobo  was written by paul naschy in a hurry . original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by jos mara zabalza  a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production . he was often unable to work  though he did find time to instruct his   year old nephew to make some alterations to the script  and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited . zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschy  s previous movies   mark of the wolfman  . the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different  and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie . post production was a nightmare . nobody knew who was doing the editing  the money ran out  the master print disappeared for a while  and then at a pre  release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater . he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb .  br    br   yet somehow the film works  if you let it . it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles  vaulted catacombs  chains  whips  gloomy moors . fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn  t make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution . in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning in the next shot its bone dry and he  s howling at the full moon . then its raining again . and yet you don  t look at it as a gaffe . its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible  opposites are the same  and effects proceed causes first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams  and then the cable starts sparking with electricity . people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness   i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend . it is a marvel of making something out of nothing  and succeeds not because of what it could of had  but because of what it does . it  s easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it . the trick is being able to see through the mayhem  or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect .  br    br   paul naschy died last week at the age of   . he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more  was working on film projects right up until his last days  but passed away in madrid  spain  with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment . his rich  varied  and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest . and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like  fury of the wolfman  in rapt awe . even people who don  t like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at  if only for just a minute in a couple spots . you can find it for free at archive . org or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel . it  s worth far  far more .  br    br   amusingly  naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted  sick  demented little movie as a classic  if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia . the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive . i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him  but i will say this i  d rather watch  fury of the wolfman  in its dingiest  most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing  obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekend .  br    br   the world lost a great artist this month . watch his films  and remember .  br    br        \n",

      "the biggest reason i had to see this movie was that it stars susan swift  an outstanding and all  too  underappreciated actress . time travel movies usually don  t interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft  but this movie was fascinating and creepy . it didn  t rely on outrageous special effects and it didn  t focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused . this was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all .  \n",

      "picture bride has an excellent look into hawaii  s past and the people who lived there in that time . the time  money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live  takes a whole new meaning to blood  sweat and tears .  br    br   the concept of dating  matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net . just that is more of snail mail . very slow snail mail .  br    br   the singing of the plantation  s songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers  songs of their demise and future goals .  br    br   the movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that hawaii can bring . like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility .  \n",

      "i saw this when it premiered and just re  watched it on ifc again . this is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to hawai  i to work the sugar plantations in the early      s . my grandparents were part of that migration my parents were born on a kohala plantation  big island  at the time setting of the movie . i moved to the big island over a year ago after living in california for over   years . i was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped  with wild cane still growing  years after the plantations closed . i  ve heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation . this movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories . this story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot  driven movie . it leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman  s . some people just don  t get it .  br    br   i didn  t recall that youki kudoh had the starring role  with which she did an incredible job . i recall her great performances in jim jarmusch  s  mystery train  and in an australian film  co  starring with russell crowe   heaven  s burning  . tamlyn tomita did a great job with her pidgin english  especially for someone who didn  t grow up in the islands . i had forgotten that toshiro mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator . and i missed the fact that jason scott lee had an uncredited  non  speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene .  br    br   i was saddened to find out that the director and co  writer  kayo hatta  died in an accidental drowning in     .  br    br   there are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience  gaijin  about the immigrant cane workers in brazil  many of them japanese  in the same time period and  sugar cane alley  about the cane plantation experience in africa . the latter is still available  but  gaijin   sadly  doesn  t appear to have been shown in quite a while . another great film about the early asian in america experience when immigrants were more like slaves is  a thousand pieces of gold  . this was set over the chinese workers  involvement in the building of the railroad  starred rosalind chao  chris cooper  michael paul chan  and dennis dun .  \n",

      "distortion is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise . . a sort of multi layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right at this moment . to be more concise  he feels that his wife is cheating on him  so he hires a private eye to snoop on him . his wife has no idea that this is happening . meanwhile  the actors in this play are also having a few whoopdedoodles up their sleeves by fooling around with each other and with  shall we say  unscrupulous people in the world of israel . the whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable  but not really  happens .  br    br   the director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the ensemble cast of characters  and edits in a way that makes you pay attention  this is a fun film actually  one which i didn  t mind viewing and would recommend people check out .  \n",
      "this is arguably the best film director haim bouzaglo made until now . a skilled tv director  well  trained in story  telling and in directing his actors through long epics he tried to catch in this very low  budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks  resulting in  distorted  lives . each character trying to live his own life  to watch and control the other  while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure  by political and historical forces well beyond his control . some call this destiny  but destiny has a very concrete representation in this film .  br    br   there is no explicit political saying in  distortion  . characters never discuss politics  not even at the level of saying  bastards   when they hear that a new terror attack happens . their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded . they do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb  and waiting for the next one to happen . personal  social  professional life seems to work someway  but is deeply flawed and influenced by events . the main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid  life personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that he is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes . he hires a private detective to follow his girlfriend who is a tv investigative reporter whom he suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show  another failed man  former military  whose business and family life dismantles under the events . he starts to write a play that carbon  copies the reality and will bring it to the stage  in theater in film scene that reminds hamlet as well as  synecdoche  new york  . it  s not that i would dare suspect charlie kaufman looking over the shoulder of bouzaglo  he certainly needs not that  but the israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film  and the first directed by kaufman  . as in the american film actors play real persons and start interacting with them in an reality  meets  stage  meets  reality melange which never lacks logic  at least not artistic logic .  br    br   bouzaglo directs his actors with the usual talent  trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them . his style is much more free here than in his tv series  and the  distortion  effects  although borrowed from american horror movies work pretty well all over . the ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically  but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film .  \n",
      "distortion is a disturbing  haunting film  about life imitating art and art reflecting life . haim bouzaglo  the director of the film  plays the role of haim bouzaglo  artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright  who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friend  s documentary . as an arab suicide bomber  disguised in skullcap and american t  shirt  wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves  haim transcribes his girl friend  s life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors  lives during rehearsals . but the bomber has already struck and haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier . despite the manipulation of time and space  the story is crystal clear  comprehensive and absorbing  a brilliant commentary on the  distortion  of everyday israeli life  where the political is intertwined with the personal  where everyone lives  on the edge   and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone else  s dramatic narrative .  br    br   bouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone else  s production brilliantly . we are always voyeurs  seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the  real  director chooses to reveal . to remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy  bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom  sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop   and repeatedly frames his views within tv  video  or security screens . actors play the role of actors who represent the  real  characters played by actors . of course  each of the actors is the star of his or her own production  only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actor  s personal films . the detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play . the actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for  tips  on how to play the role  is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes  and they attend a cast party as their real selves .  br    br   despite this multiplicity of views  there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative the playwright searches for subject matter  the bomber seeks a target  and the detective stalks the filmmaker . nor is there any difficulty locating bouzaglo  s ultimate targetenervated and impotent israel  fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action . israel is bouzaglo  the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play . israel is also the bankrupt soldier  entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmaker  s documentary  the cheating actors and actresses  and the cuckolded husband . they are all israel because they are all helpless  caught in inaction or aimless action  as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target . all the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep  score  of victims .  br    br   there is personal triumph  vindication  perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film  but viewers will be left aching for the state of israel even as they are filled with admiration for bouzaglo  s memorable rendition of a nation  s plight within the telling of an individual  s story .  \n",
      "i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well viewed from an israeli perspective  i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie . what i would like to say is that  distortion  was shown at a film festival in geneva in november      festival  cinma tout cran   where it won the award of the audience   prix du public  in french  . for what affects me  i liked the  nervous camera  work of mr bouzaglo  who  in my opinion  portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well  and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie . this perspective  however  might seem totally  alien  to an israeli viewer  but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers  because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack . it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in geneva judged this film with a much more  detached  perspective . i would also like to quote what mr bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a geneva newspaper  i  m translating from french     after   years of living here and after undergoing all this violence  we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal . we might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living . we are like the characters in my movie    on the edge of the edge   . this is the reason why the private detective  who is somehow   voyeur   is the happiest character in the movie  because he earns a living thanks to the system  he takes advantage of this situation   this is  in substance  the main thing that i and the swiss public  in my opinion  pointed out in this movie  and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor . so  to sum up  different countrydifferent perspective  but i think that this is somehow great  because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema  that is to say that it well never be subject to a  unique  of  formatted  way of thinking .  \n",

      "great little thriller . i was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what i got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time . mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed . o such foolishness here . yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals . such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled . we saw them so we could just how efficient the lisa character was and how inefficient the new hotel clerk was . we see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose . the flight atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead . the bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight . the rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too . the only  characters that were just  liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane . that was clever because i thought they would have something to do with plot . from the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named lisa is in charge . even when jackson shows his true colors she doesn  t panic . she thinks what she can do to stall time . any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots . but not this one . it was a very short movie and i was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast . thankfuly none of them were used . the new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do  which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything  or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her . was craven should do more of these types of movies . also one last comment . brian cox is in the movie but i had not one clue who he was . i had to come over here to see that he is lisa  s father . he is completely unrecognizable .  \n",

      "  a very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with . as the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man jack becomes deadly as he threatens lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in  or else have her father die . see now that  s what you happens when you fly coach  stuff like that never happens in first class .  br    br    other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight  the other thing that this movie shares with  flightplan  is the sheer unbelievability if that  s a word of the story . the point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician  s room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan  but won  t it have being easier for jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel  s system  teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers  so i  m pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie .  br    br    plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about . this is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something . but i  m     sure that i  m reading way too much into it . the movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of     so one can  t be perplexed by such complexities . for all my complaints though  this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done . it  s not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain  but at the same time it doesn  t require great intelligence to fully enjoy .  br    br    i  d love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really i can  t . i love rachel mcadams  i love cillian murphy  and i like brian cox  but they don  t really stretch their acting muscles here . it  s not really much of a problem since this isn  t the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting isn  t the least bit horrible  just not great . wes craven isn  t exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this  but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script . it was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing  cursed  and as much as i liked him doing something different with this movie  i still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it  s release .  br    br    one nice thing about the movie which i really appreciated was just how short the movie was . it is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while  but nowadays it  s like every movie that comes out feels too long  where as this movie just felt like the right length . not too long  and too short . they don  t waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this isn  t the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie . being a huge film music geek  i have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by marco beltrami . it  s really nice to see beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he  s doing now . i really the cool techno  orchestral stuff he does for the main titles . too bad that i can  t find the soundtrack anywhere  would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime i wanted instead of having to pop in the dvd when i want to hear it .  br    br    overall it  s nice for what it is and whiles it  s far from great cinema  should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half  \n",
      "this is an excellent  fast paced thriller by wes craven  nightmare on elm street   who for   minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying  the evil of human beings . we are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of jackson rippner than freddy kruger  and cillian murphy  batman begins  does an excellent job of presenting a sociable  friendly  even charismatic killer . the performances by murphy and by rachel mcadams  claire  from the wedding crashers  are brilliant . most of the film takes place on a very intimate level  between two people  their eyes  their faces . it is action on a small scale  not the broad sweep of the canvas  and it is no less compelling for these limitations . the cinematography is nothing special  though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet  but the dialog is excellent  the story taut . there are no distractions  no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters . by keeping his focus and avoiding distractions  wes craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting  fast  paced action thriller .  \n",

      "  intervention  has helped me with my own addictions and recovery . i  m a middle  aged married father of two . i  m quite functional in my personal and professional life . still  i have pain from my past that i use addictions to soothe  and issues from which i am slowly recovering . when these addicts and their families share their lives with me  they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family .  br    br   the show  unlike many others  digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction . many of us suffer because it  s too scary to go back and do  as alice miller says   the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood .  the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started . this digging is painful and difficult  but worth it . so much coverage of addiction   fictional and non  fictional   seems to ignore the underlying issues . often it  s assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self  interest  and now they can  t stop . not so addictions are about killing pain . i can relate to the different events and hardships in people  s lives . there are common themes  and surprising exceptions . many addicts have suffered miserable abuse . some kids simply respond badly to divorce . to those who think that addiction is an over  reaction to a hardship  i would just say that different people respond differently . although some kids handle divorce well  others  like cristy in the show   collapse in a heap on the floor  and have their lives forever changed by the event .  br    br   for example  last night  s counselor said that pretty young andrea seeks validation from men . she strips for cash for a    year old neighbor and lets men abuse her . sound familiar to anyone  the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives . often it  s those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest . as they say  even a stopped watch is right twice a day  but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while  until it  s made your life miserable .  br    br   to the producers thank you for making the show  for digging into the past  for the follow  ups . also  the graphics  the format  and the theme music are brilliant .  br    br   to the addicts thank you for your courage to share . whether or not you have helped yourself  you have helped me .  \n",
      "i find i enjoy this show  but the format needs some work . first off  the good attributes . i like how this show will take us through the day  to  day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they  ve allowed their lives to become . this is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome . intervention doesn  t candy  coat things and sometimes the outcome  often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing  is a negative outcome . this makes the positive outcomes all the better .  br    br   another thing i like about the show is the quality of the camera work . given the reality that these cameramen have to squeeze anywhere and don  t have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable . it  s actually superior to scripted shows like  the shield  where the photography is so bad it can induce nausea .  br    br   now for the bad . an episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show . you  ll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you  re thrown into the story of another . get caught up in that story then suddenly you  re back to the first addict . . . or are you  by now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to . this constant flip  flopping between addicts really gets disruptive during the intervention scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated interventions  i once heard the marketing b . s . reason for this poor design  the show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to absorb what they  re watching .  oh please . clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that aren  t big enough for an hour show so they mix two together . by mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block  like they should  it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing  and the commercials  if they are interested in one case but not the other .  br    br   i used to find these  blender  episodes so annoying that i  d only tell my tivo to record episodes containing one addict  but then it became easier just to record all of them .  \n",
      "this show is awesome  i have been a fan since it premiered  and it only keeps me watching . . . i  ve seen some terrible things here  that i wish i hadn  t  but  it really shows you how addiction affects all involved  not just the addict . you can see all kinds of different addictions  from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict  or the eating disorder addict . and actually  it  s really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also . we  ve seen accomplished musicians  an nba player  and even young people  who really need the help . and since they have started showing a few follow  ups  that  s been awesome too . now  you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired . if you haven  t checked this one out  please do . it  s on ae  and it  s awesome  the new eps are sunday nights at   pm est  if i remember correctly . . . so set your tivo   \n",

      "there are people claiming this is another  bad language  ultra violence mexican movie . they are right  but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become . the awful truth hurts  or bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal . one of the most important things of  cero y van cuatro  is the open invitation to profound reflexion over our current identity . is that what we all are  is that all that we want to be  i am abroad and i realized how spoiled is the mexican society when the tlahuac incident came to light . i still cannot understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcasted murder . i nearly puked when i saw some of the images . it was not irak or rwanda  just a tiny village near mexico city when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government . the recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply . the other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption  dishonesty  betrayal and violence  but i consider  tamales de chivo  the best one .  br    br   the movie is deeper than some  cabrn  and  pendejo  screams . those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people . with a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish . just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in our country . moreover  honesty is only rewarded miraculously .  \n",

      "when friendship kills  in my opinion  is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic . anytime lexi  katie wright  or jennifer  marley shelton  threw up  i wanted to vomit myself . it  s kind of hard to explain why . if you ask me  they should have been more cooperative about things . however  i did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents . before i wrap this up  i  d like to say   if you ask me  when friendship kills does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person  s body .  now  in conclusion  i recommend this movie to everyone who hasn  t seen it . you  re in for some tears and a good time  so the next time it  s on tv  kick back with a friend and watch it .  \n",
      "i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one . it deals with issues that most directors shy away from  my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldn  t buy a copy for my friend   br    br   it  s a touching story about how people with eating disorders don  t necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies . it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight  it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of .  \n",

      "i agree with the above comment  i love the realism in this  and in many movies  not just movies on eating disorders  the producers seem to forget that . they take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again  which i dislike because its not reality . not meaning to say things can  t get better  and not meaning to say things don  t in this movie  but it doesn  t spend most of the movie creating all these problems  and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again . when people have eating disorders people don  t just admit it and want to get better  and then life is peachy  it takes time  and i like how in this movie we grow with the characters  we go through the difficulties with them  getting better and worse  because it is a very important part of the movie . it gets into the minds of people with eating disorders  and shows the complications and pain  in a very realistic way  and i loved that . i also love how it shows the secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders  it is scary to see how people react when they find out  especially if they approve of it . i thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told  and defiantly one of my favourites .  \n",
      "there are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them . this film shows it as it is . it is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy  it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful . i  ve only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel . it is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop . this is what films should be about  they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong .  \n",
      "i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one . the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it . this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesn  t automatically just get better . she gets better and then has a drawback . i think this movie shows more than the others that i  ve seen that getting better doesn  t just happen  it  s hard work and takes time  it  s a long path to recovery . i think this movie shows all of that very well . there should be more movies like this .  \n",
      "the surprise nominee of this year  s best animated feature race at the oscars . it  s an irish film by heart  but it was co  produced by belgium and brazil  with  i  m guessing  animators working in all three countries . the product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory . the character design is a little reminiscent of the french animated film persepolis from a couple of years back  with very simple characters with thick  black outlines . this film is not in black and white . oh no . what makes this film great is its use of color  simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors i  ve ever seen . the general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical  with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals . much of the film can be spent playing find the circle  a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image . all of these geometrical designs have a purpose  the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts  the book of kells is a real illuminated bible the art of the film is based on the drawings in it  . the story of the film isn  t especially deep  but it  s a pretty good fantasy tale . brendan is a young boy in kells  a city surrounded by enormous walls  built by his uncle to keep out vikings . a newcomer to kells  brother aiden  inspires brendan to take up illustrating . he also inspires him to do things like leave kells and explore the nearby forest  within which lives a nymph . bruno coulais provides a fantastic score  almost as good as the one he did for coraline  which i consider the very best of the year .  \n",

      "as one other imdb reviewer has remarked  this movie starts a bit slow  but gets considerably better as it goes along . yes  it is released by roger corman  and yes  it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy . however  the juxtapositioning of the wife  s career as a rising blues singer against the husband  s gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical  void  or  hole  while she  s away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done . utilizing a very small number of locations and characters  and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout  this movie  though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget  reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario  namely the french film  swimming pool  which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from  up against amanda .  with a smaller tool set  up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary  fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations  but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre . the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past  again  very freudian  is also very unique in this genre and interesting . i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amanda  s plight this aspect of the story elicits . the cast is excellent i think .  br    br    \n",

      "while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end  i wanted to give the movie a solid  or  . i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on . even my a . d . d couldn  t keep up . it felt like a slight acid trip . everything looked flat  there was no dimension to anything . there were so many shapes  lines and patterns . i really wanted to stop the movie mid  way and smash my burned copy of this movie . but after i finish watching it  i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watching .  br    br   the secret of kells is loosely based on the true story about the original book of kells . a small boy  brendan  is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written . this book will contain information that will help  change darkness into light .  brendan lives in the village of kells behind huge stone walls . taking place in the  th century  brendan  s uncle  the abbot of kells  is trying to build the wall to keep the vikings out . brendan  s uncle insist he help complete the wall  but a traveler and keeper of  the book  secretly trains brendan to hone in on his illustration skills  and convinces him to complete  the book  and carry out it  s word .  br    br   the entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didn  t really understand what was going on . i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history . a simple google search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of kells . after reading many articles  my opinion of the movie greatly changed .  br    br   the book of kells is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament transcribed into latin by gaelic monks in ireland in the  th century . along with it  s paleographic and insular script  the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art  a type of early art form know for it  s intricacy  complexity  and miniature illustrations . much of the art in the book of kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time  flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective . but what makes the book of kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it  s use of many colors .  br    br   the secret of kells is very colorful . i originally thought the animation was flat and boring . it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and  amine  look to it . once i learned about the art styles of the book of kells  it  s obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie . there are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit brendan  s mind . whenever he goes into his imagination  circular shapes resembling the sun  cogs  clocks and wheels begin filling the screen . the edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles . transitions are filled with color  and celtic knots . from the trees to the floors  many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns .  br    br   clocking in at   minutes minus credits  the secret of kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people  maybe just children  interested . i think one has to generally be open  mined to the secret of kells as half art piece  half movie about history . despite looking like it was animated with adobe illustrator  it  s a very nice looking movie . but based on the   films submitted for oscar consideration  i don  t think it was worth being nominated over mary and max .  br    br   thatwasjunk . blogspot . com  \n",

      "the secret of kells is an independent  animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the book of kells  an illuminated manuscript from the middle ages featuring the four gospels of the new testament . i didn  t know that this book actually exists  but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier . there are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be  who wrote it  and how it has survived over      years . this is one of them .  br    br   we are introduced to brendan  an orphan who lives at the abbey of kells in ireland with his uncle  abbot cellach  voiced by brendan gleeson  . abbot cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks . brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks . they are more focused on reading and writing  something abbot cellach does not have time for anymore . he fears the  northmen   those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the ground .  br    br   one day a traveler comes from the island of iona near scotland . it is brother aidan  a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished . abbot cellach grants him permission to stay and brendan buddies up with him . aidan has special plans for brendan . first he needs ink for the book  but he requires specific berries . the only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest  an area off limits to brendan . seeing that he is the only chance for aidan to continue his work  he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence .  br    br   in the forest brendan meets ashley  the protector of the forest . she allows brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company . she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it . there are things worse than vikings out there . from there brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasion .  br    br   i like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about . knowing now what the book of kells is and what it contains  the animation makes perfect sense . i  m sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago  with frilly borders  colorful pictures  and extravagant patterns  creatures  and writings adorning the pages . much like the opening frames of disney  s the sword in the stone . the animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns . it creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other .  br    br   i couldn  t take my eyes off of the incredible detail . this is some of the finest  d animation i have seen in years . it  s vibrant  stimulating  and full of life . the characters are constantly surrounded by designs  doodles  and patterns in trees  on the walls  and in the air just floating around . it enhances the film .  br    br   the story is satisfactory  although i think the ending could have been strung out a little more . with a runtime of only   minutes i think there could have been something special in the final act . it doesn  t give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book . we are reminded of it  s importance but never fully understand . we are told that it gives hope  but never why or how . that was really the only lacking portion of the film . otherwise i thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation .  br    br   i guess that  s okay to a certain degree . the animation can carry a film so far before it falls short . the story lacks a few parts  but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history . i would recommend looking up briefly the book of kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about . i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more . this a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed .  \n",
      "the secret of kells is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart . the shortcomings of the film  s limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young brendan  s heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages . historically this was in the late  th century  when the centers of irish learning were over  run by the vikings . the vikings appear here as brute antagonists  the equivalent on the north seas of the plundering huns and mongols further east . the film  s narrative    which functions more as a parable    centers around the conflict between brendan  who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness  and his stern uncle the abbot   who seeks to protect the town of kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the norsemen . the abbot disregards the value of brendan  s art in his quest for security . this is the movie  s outer conflict . brendan  s inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the book of kells . this eye is guarded by a dragon ouroboros  who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the vikings will kill from without  that  s as much of the story as i  ll divulge    br    br   what i really like about this film is its creators  imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the west from     years ago . the characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original book of kells .  particularly noteworthy is monk aidan  s pet cat  defined in few lines  yet purely    and even magically metamorphically feline .  the range of emotion which brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators . the decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene  and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in the secret of kells . of course  historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict . however  by introducing archetypal elements into this story  the writers and director of the secret of kells convey a numinous sense of lived  life from that far  off time in ireland which feels psychologically true  however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact .  the united nations  band of illuminators who appear as a rogues  club of artists in the secret of kells aren  t historically probable  but they  re all well  designed  individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially irish story .  animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures . the magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source  but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling if animation had existed in the dark ages  the secret of kells is what it would look like  finally  brendan  s hero  s quest in this film is the artist  s perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty  life and inspiration .  without being preachy or even particularly christian  this movie affirms jesus  dictum that  man does not live by bread alone .   in my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is andrei tarkovsky  s andrei rublev  a film about the great russian icon painter of the   th century . the secret of kells expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist  s visual quest and creative process . it  s certainly not as profound as andrei rublev  but    heck    its a cartoon   and one which will appeal to young and old alike .  i think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing in its own modest life  affirming way  this stylized secret of kells is a classic .  \n",
      "i would not have known about this film if not for its  surprise  oscar nomination for best animated feature film . thankfully  it came to pass that i was able to watch this animated little treasure .  br    br   the story is about the child brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of the township of kells . the main pre  occupation of the abbot is to build a wall to protect kells from the attacking vikings . one day  aiden  the renowned illustrator from iona  sought refuge with them . aiden opens brendan  s eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world . along the way  brendan befriended the white forest sprite aisling  as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration .  br    br    the secret of kells  is unlike most of the animation released these days . it is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism  as much as symbolism . the movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of  kung fu panda .  however  it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience . the reds used in the viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting .  br    br   try to catch this quiet gem of a film . it is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as  monsters vs . aliens  and the like . the sparse celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film . ok  the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting . i would have liked to know more about the book that brendan and aiden was working on . but the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork  said to be based on the artwork in the real book of kells .  \n",

      "the secret of kells is a film i  ve been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the cartoon saloon in kilkenny . i  m here to tell you now it  s been worth the wait . the cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as i  d feared . the whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination  i particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page . the characterisation is superb  i love brendan gleeson  s voice as the stern abbot and i especially liked the voice of the sprite aisling . the forest is a triumph  such a beautiful place . the story is well realised  a mix of fact and fantasy . and really draws the viewer in to cheer on brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the book . i  m a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart  but all the people i know who  ve seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that it  s a lovely little film . i will definitely buy the dvd when it  s released  and would like to say  well done cartoon saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project . may there be many more .   coming back in here to say that i bought several copies of the dvd as soon as i could and gave them out at christmas  everyone loves it  and i wish them all the luck in the world at the oscars  such a joy to see this nominated .  \n",
      "by      and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces  errol flynn  s hold over u . s . box office had started to decline so  in spite of the increased burden of waning looks  he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler . the first of these was a good one actually  adventures of don juan        but it also proved to be his last big  budget hollywood starring vehicle . the rest of his sword  wielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim        the master of ballantrae       and the dark avenger        in france for adventures of captain fabian       and italy for the aborted the story of william tell       and the little  seen crossed swords       . however  hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways  albeit for a modestly  budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers a  production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak  br    br   still  the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and  while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self  his red  headed leading lady maureen o  hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady . anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger  than  life starring vehicles  so here he is typically seen as the baddie  the pirate captain roc brasiliano  a role he attacks with gusto . like the black shield of falworth        a viewing of which preceded this one  against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels .  br    br   for all i know  this might well have been the very first pirate movie i  ve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of today  s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about  as i said earlier  against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it  s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same . nowadays  the amorous persistence of the child  like indian princess  alice kelley  towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it  despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk       and the black swan        to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars  is briskly paced and reasonably engaging . incidentally  the film would later go on to be remade as the king  s pirate       with doug mcclure   br    br   for what it  s worth  the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and  as a matter of fact  against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly  thought out pirates of the golden age movie collection set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneer  s girl       with yvonne de carlo   doule crossbones       with donald o  connor  and yankee buccaneer       with jeff chandler   value for money  perhaps but  so far  i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so  if the mood strikes me in future  i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyk  s mutiny        the afore  mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga       .  \n",

      "many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow . although the story  line was rather typical of clara  s later silents  i still find it somewhat heart  stirring and incredibly fun . clara plays a happy  go  lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves . . . never mind that this man is married  clara  s lack of modesty was shocking in the day  but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie . though definitely not a brilliant story  line  quite typical  actually   this movie is a nice showcase of clara  s ability to make the audience laugh .  \n",
      "there  s a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist  actually exist right now . it  s a bit too much to wrap your head around  but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place . for barbara jean trenton  ida lupino   that time was twenty five years earlier  the mid      s when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise . for my part  if i could travel through time  it would be back to the      s when i grew up . maybe to a place like willoughby  but that  s another episode .  br    br   one thing that wouldn  t be so special about     would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of  the twilight zone  . how many reels do you think it would take to catalog the entire series  and then find a particular story you wanted to watch  i guess you have to consider the trade offs  convenience versus simplicity  having it right now or taking the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the story begins . popping in a cd has it  s advantages .  br    br   i  m a little surprised that rod serling would pen a story that so closely resembled  sunset boulevard  . ida lupino  s character mirror imaged norma desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept . martin balsam portrays very much a similar character to erich von stroheim  the husband turned butler who  s loyalty is unquestioned . where the story diverges has to do with the way danny  balsam  and sall  ted de corsia  challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs that paralyze her existence .  br    br   fortunately for us viewers  ida lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were  not big  but a nice showcase  . it  s a real treat to watch any episode of  the twilight zone  and get to see who pops up from days gone by . sometimes you get a two  fer  like you have here with lupino and balsam  celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began  and sometimes after . combined with the stories that the program produced  it  s not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today .  \n",
      "i really enjoyed this episode  which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired . from a pure writing perspective   the   mm shrine  is an absolute treat  with fantastic dialogue and character analysis  typical of sterling . in particular i really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode  tackling themes of existence and reality  whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial  pride  and desire .  the sixteen  millimeter shrine  is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever  changing world . it is also a fantastic example of cerebral twilight zone one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it . these elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting   minutes .  br    br   the episode is not without its faults however  which mainly lay in lupino and leisen shoes . ironically  i felt lupino was unconvincing throughout  with only a few scenes that could count as memorable . this of course being an absolute shame considering how well sterling had written her character . furthermore leisen didn  t seem to know what to do with most of his characters  sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing  which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from lupino half the time  . thankfully balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots  helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least .  br    br   as i said previously however  if you  re a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction  this shouldn  t be as bad as it  s sometimes made out to be . in addition to the writing that i mentioned above  the episode also features some fantastic photography  it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later   and decent enough set  design . overall  the sixteen  millimeter shrine  is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think .  \n",
      "after hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat  serling continued to go about introducing viewers to  the twilight zone  in a very strange way by scheduling one the series biggest growers as the fourth episode .  the sixteen  millimeter shrine  is one of the more understated episodes  focusing on an aging movie star  s inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes . because of this approach  the episode is under whelming at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short story .  br    br   both the leads  ida lupino as barbara jean trent and martin balsam as her frustrated but caring agent  shine in their performances . the main problem with the episode is that the supposedly   year old footage of the actress is unconvincing . lupino looks identical when playing the young trent as she does when playing the middle aged trent and this diminishes the tragedy of the situation significantly . fortunately  lupino acts her socks off in convincing us of her desperation to return to the past . it  s a situation most can sympathise with  and yet trent is far from a sympathetic character . she is a prima  donna who gives little thought to the feelings of those around her  such as the disastrously withered co  star who she tactlessly belittles because he reminds her of just how long ago her glory days were . it is somewhat surprising  then  that she is rewarded with a happy ending . it is clear what is going to happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen and it is cleverly pre  empted in the opening moments when trent scares her maid by stepping out from behind the screen . what is not clear at the beginning  however  is whether being sucked into the projector will prove a reward or a harsh lesson in appreciating what we have and living in the moment . as it turns out  trent is allowed to return to the past she longed for  a testament to how strong the wishful thinking of humans can be .  br    br    the sixteen  millimeter shrine  gets better with each viewing . the top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past  even though we can never return . except in the twilight zone .  \n",

This is equivalent to what you saw in the video when Andrew set specific indices to 1.
